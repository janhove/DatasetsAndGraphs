  Abstract                 = {Age effects in second language acquisition (SLA) are often construed as evidence for a maturationally based critical period. However, an analysis of end-state SLA research reveals little congruence with geometric and temporal features of critical periods. In particular, there is no apparent period within which age effects are observed; rather, they persist indefinitely. We see that not only are maturation and aging distinct biological processes, but also their behavioral effects are not realized in comparable ways. Our understanding of age effects in SLA must also take into account the significant incidence of nativelike attainment among late learners. This incidence can be roughly predicted from the slope of the age function. This chapter concludes with a discussion of factors that influnce the slope of the age function.},

  Abstract                 = {Age effects in first and second language learning are a well-known phenomenon. Any layperson is familiar with stories of immigrant families where, after a few years, the children speak like native speakers of the same age while the parents keep being recognized as non-natives for the rest of their lives. The popular press has also familiarized many with the concept of "feral children", raised in circumstances of extreme neglect, and unable to become full-fledged speakers of any language after being rescued from their situation at an age beyond which first language learning (L1) is largely complete under normal circumstances (see, e.g. BenzaquÃÂÃÂ©n, 2006; Rymer, 1992). As is often the case, the media have promoted simplistic implications of these phenomena, such as a presumed impossibility of adults becoming highly skilled in a second language (L2) and the presumed ability of elementary school programs to instill a high level of L2 skill in all children, thus making it seem that age is the one and only determinant of success at language learning.},

  Abstract                 = {A large amount of empirical evidence shows that age of acquisition is strongly negatively correlated with ultimate second language proficiency for grammar as well as for pronunciation. It is even doubtful that any evidence exists at this point of any person having learned a second language perfectly in adulthood. Some researchers have rightly pointed out that correlation is not causation, and that the age effect may be caused by confounded variables such as quantity and quality of input, amount of practice, level of motivation, and other social variables. Many studies, however, have shown that these variables play a very limited role when the effect of age of acquisition is removed statistically, but age of acquisition keeps playing a large role when the social and environmental variables are removed. Other researchers have objected to a "critical period" interpretation of such age effects because these do not show the discontinuities that would b eexpected under the critical period hypothesis. We argue here, however, that quite a few studies have documented discontinuities, and that their absence in some studies may be because of a variety of confounding variables and other methodological problems. Assuming there is indeed a maturational decline in second language learning capacity during childhood, then there is a need to investigate whether this decline affects competence, performance, or both and what the ultimate cause of this decline is. Increasingly, evidence points toward fundamental maturational changes in certain aspects of memory. The challenge for critical period researchers is to tie such changes to both specific neurological antecedents and specific psycholinguistic corollaries. Regardless of one's view of the critical period, it is important not to overinterpret its implications for educational practice. The observation that "earlier is better" only applies to certain kinds of learning, which schools typically cannot provide. Therefore, the implication of critical period research seems to be that instruction should be adapted to the age of the learner, not that learners should necessarily be taught at a young age.},

This article presents a critical overview of the studies that have been conducted on inter-Scandinavian language understanding, pointing out that none of them really seems to be able to provide a secure answer to the question of how well Scandinavians can understand each other's languages. This mainly depends on methodological problems. Moreover, the article represents a survey of different methods that have been used or possibly could be used to investigate inter-Scandinavian language understanding. The survey makes clear that test results are strongly affected by the method chosen and that these effects ought to be taken into account when the above-mentioned investigations into understanding between Danes, Norwegians and Swedes are used for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {The idea that children have a special talent for languages that is rarely, if ever, available to older learners is one that has much popular support. Among second language researchers, however, the related hypothesis of a maturationally delimited critical period for language acquisition has been a constant source of controversy. Not everyone accepts the view that young children have an inborn advantage over older learners, and even among those who take this position, debate continues as to what the causes of this advantage are, what the relevant age limits are, what aspects of language development it applies to, and what sort of empirical data provide a crucial test of the critical period hypothesis. In this chapter, we review relevant research findings and consider various proposed explanations of age-related differences in (second) language acquisition. We argue that, despite a number of unresolved problems and even some apparent counterevidence, the critical period concept, as it has evolved, continues to have considerable heuristic value in investigating the language development of learners whose exposure to a new language begins at different ages.},

Each group comprised 12 subjects, all of whom were students at upper secondary level. The bilingul speakers were judged by their teachers to speak Swedish without any noticeable foreign accent in everyday oral conversation. They had all started their second language acquisition before puberty, some at pre-school age (< 6) and some at school-age (> 7). The bilingual and monolingual speakers had earlier been shown not to differ significantly on measures designed to tap language proficiency in cognitively demanding linguistic tasks (Hyltenstam & Stroud, in preparation). On measures of lexical/grammatical accuracy and appropriateness, however, the topic of the present analysis, there were clear differences between bilingual and monolingual speakers of Swedish. The results in the present paper are presented against the background of the notions of completeness and fossilization.The issue of competence vs. control is also addressed. Furthermore, the relationship between ultimate attainment and age of onset of second language acquisition is treated in some detail.},

Even where they exist in large numbers, it is not always obvious how they can be exploited in language teaching, and sometimes they can be a serious source of error and difficulty. The role of individual differences in the development of the L2 lexicon is an area where research is only just getting off the ground, and we have only a hazy idea of how far cognitive styles and other verbal skills affect L2 vocabulary learning. Standard tests could play a very important role in the future study of the L2 lexicon. Most of the tests we currently use are designed for laboratory research, and they do not adapt well to more everyday situations. Development of tests that work in both situations is crucial if research on the structure of L2 lexicons is to have a real impact on how we teach and learn L2 vocabulary.},

  abstract  = {The incidence of nativelikeness in adult second language acquisition is a controversial issue in SLA research. Although some researchers claim that any learner, regardless of age of acquisition, can attain nativelike levels of second language (L2) proficiency, others hold that attainment of nativelike proficiency is, in principle, impossible. The discussion has traditionally been framed within the paradigm of a critical period for language acquisition and guided by the question of whether SLA is constrained by the maturation of the brain. The work presented in this article can be positioned among those studies that have focused exclusively on the apparent counterexamples to the critical period. We report on a large-scale study of Spanish/Swedish bilinguals (n = 195) with differning ages of onset of acquisition (< 1-47 years), all of whom identify themselves as potentially nativelike in their L2. Listening sessions with native-speaker judges showed that only a small minority of those bilinguals who had started their L2 acquisition after age 12, but a majority of those with an age of onset below this age, were actually perceived as native speakers of Swedish. However, when a subset (n = 41) of those participants who did pass for native speakers was scrutinized in linguistic detail with a battery of 10 highly complex, cognitively demanding tasks and detailed measurements of linguistic performance, representation, and processing, non of the late learners performed within the native-speaker range; in fact, the results revealed also that only a few of the early learners exhibitied actual nativelike competence and behavior on all measures of L2 proficiency that were employed. Our primary interpretation of the results is that nativelike ultimate attainment of a second langauge is, in principle, never attained by adult learners and, furthermore, is much less common among child learners than has previously been assumed.},

Younger and older listeners adapted to this accent, but older listeners showed poorer comprehension of the accent. Furthermore, perceptual learning differed across groups: The older listeners stopped learning after the first block, whereas younger listeners showed further improvement with longer exposure. Among the older participants, hearing acuity predicted the SRT as well as the effect of the novel accent on SRT. Finally, a measure of executive function predicted the impact of accent on SRT.},

The present study is an attempt to assess a wider range of native speaker reactions to stretches of discourse, produced by Danish learners of English in interview situations. These data were evaluated by 150 native British informants on 14 five-point scales labelled by bipolar adjectives. A factor analysis yielded four factors, which were interpreted as a personality factor, a content factor, a language factor, and a comprehension factor.

Results obtained on the language factor and on the comprehension factor were then compared with results obtained from an objective performance analysis of the learner texts. These comparisons indicated that whereas the correlation was highly significant between the language factor and most of the performance features analysed, only one of the performance features correlated significantly with the comprehension factor, viz. communication strategies. This lack of correlation between quantitative measures of learners' performance and evaluations of comprehension was further investigated by means of more qualitative analyses of specific aspects of the texts (errors in lexis, communication strategies, discourse structure).},

Tests of metalinguistic knowledge, language aptitude and French linguistic proficiency were administered to 509 students. The results show that levels of metalinguistic knowledge vary considerably. however, the relationship between metalinguistic knowledge and language proficiency is weak. Meta-linguistic knowledge and language proficiency appear to constitute two separate factors of linguistic ability. Moreover, there was no support for the belief that students with higher levels of metalinguistic knowledge perform better at French, or that they improve their French proficiency at higher rates than other students during university study. Whilst knowledge about language may be worthwhile in its own right, there is no evidence from this study to justify the teaching of metalinguistic knowledge as a means of improving students' linguistic proficiency.},

Neighbors have consistently been reported to facilitate responses to words in naming and lexical decision tasks. Inhibitory effects of neighbors appear to arise from sophisticated guessing strategies in the perceptual identification task or lexical decision strategies adopted in unusual stimulus environments. For English words, there is minimal evidence of competitive influences on lexical retrieval due to higher frequency neighbors. Such effects are more common in such languages as French and Spanish, perhaps because they embody a more consistent relationship between orthography and phonology. These findings provide important constraints on assumptions about the form of lexical representations and the parallel activation mechanisms assumed to underlie lexical retrieval.},

Bigram frequency, manipulated independently of neighborhood size, had no effect on lexical decision or naming performance. The data suggest that effects of neighborhood size reflect lexical similarity rather than orthographic redundancy and that they are due to lexical access rather than processes specific to lexical decision or naming tasks.

Neighborhood size refers to the number of words that can be created by changing one letter of a target word. Facilitatory effects of neighborhood size were observed for low- but not high-frequency words in all tasks except delayed naming. The data also revealed a magnified frequency effect in the lexical decision as compared with the naming task. This effect was influenced by the nature of the nonwords that had to be discriminated from words and therefore appeared to reflect the processes involved in the decision component of the lexical classification task. Overall, the results demonstrate that neighborhood size influences the lexical access process. The facilitatory nature of the neighborhood effect and its interaction with frequency provide strong support for the view that lexical access relies on an activation mechanism that is sensitive to word frequency.},

model, memory based learning, and support vector machines) are compared with
a naive discriminative learning classifier, derived from basic principles of error-
driven learning characterizing animal and human learning. Tested on the dative
alternation in English, using the Switchboard data from (BRESNAN; CUENI;
NIKITINA; BAAYEN, 2007), naive discriminative learning emerges with state-
of-the-art predictive accuracy. Naive discriminative learning offers a united
framework for understanding the learning of probabilistic distributional patterns,
for classification, and for a cognitive grounding of distinctive collexeme analysis.

  Abstract                 = {Reaction times (RTs) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of RT data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f. Forster & Dickinson, 1976). Mixed-effect modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical flexibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the RTs. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of interactions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

The subjects were 116 non-native English speakers from the Salt Lake City area. The results of this study indicate that self-ratings can be reliable and valid measures of communicative language abilities. The obtained reliabilities were much higher than had been expected, and all the self-rating measures had strong loadings on a general factor. In addition, some measures proved to be reasonably good indicators of specific language abilities. The measures of grammatical competence appear to be better indicators of this trait than are the measures of pragmatic and sociolinguistic competence.

Reporting of effect size in the psychological literature is patchy – though this may be changing – and when reported it is far from clear that appropriate effect size statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized effect size and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized effect size unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) effect size is more robust and versatile than standardized effect size. Guidelines for deciding what effect size metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: (i) a preference for simple effect size over standardized effect size, and (ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate effect size statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers.},

Our results, on the basis of 281 articles, indicate that around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsitencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers' expectations. We classified the most common errors and contacted authors to shed light on the origins of the errors.},

The influence of most variables was highly task dependent, with the results shedding light on recent empirical controversies in the available word recognition literature. Semantic-level variables accounted for unique variance in both speeded naming and lexical decision performance, with the latter task producing the largest semantic-level effects.

The theoretical analysis integrates evolutionary and ontogenetic perspectives on cultural and human development across several levels of analysis. Specific predictions are advanced dealing with the general architecture of lifespan ontogeny, including its directionality and age-differential allocation of developmental resources into the three major goals of developmental adaptation: growth, maintenance, and regulation of loss. Consistent with this general lifespan architecture, a meta-theory of development is outlined that is based on the orchestrated and adaptive interplay between three processes of behavioral regulation: selection, optimization, and compensation. Finally, these propositions and predictions about the general nature of lifespan development are examined and supported by empirical evidence on the development of cognition and intelligence across the life span.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂgold standardÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

Simultaneously, if information-processing speed is basic to g, then computational speed should correlate not only with g but also with subsidiary facets of intelligence, such as crystallized intelligence (GC). These important relationships were explored using the inspection time (IT) measure of information-processing speed together with the O scale of the NEO-PI R (Costa & McCrae, 1995) and separate psychometric tests of g (Raven's Matrices) and GC (vocabulary and comprehension). Raven's and the Gc measure correlated .598, while IT correlated with both Ravens (r=ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ.558) and GC (r=ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ.401) supporting a basic role of computational speed in g. O correlated significantly with GC (r=.338), but not with Raven's nor with IT. Structural equation modeling supported two models in which O was independent of g, with IT being basic to g, and with GC reflecting the joint action of g and O. Paths from O to IT or to Raven's were not significant, suggesting that any apparent relationship of O to intelligence is due not to effects of O on ability, but rather to the effects of O on interest in knowledge, a joint final path with ability.},

Multiple testing theory provides a framework for defining and controlling appropriate error rates in order to protect against wrong conclusions. However, the corresponding multiple test procedures are underutilized in biomedical and epidemiological research. In this article, the existing multiple test procedures are summarized for the most important multiplicity situations. It is emphasized that adjustments for multiple testing are required in confirmatory studies whenever results from multiple tests have to be combined in one final conclusion and decision. In case of multiple significance tests a note on the error rate that will be controlled for is desirable.},

Little is known about methods for improving the intelligibility of a closely related language. In this paper we focus on improving the intelligibility of spoken Frisian for Dutch speakers. In a 50-minute instruction session, participants got information about the most frequent sound correspondences between Dutch and Frisian, e.g. /sk/ in Frisian is often /sx/ in Dutch. The results of the intelligibility test show no significant improvement, neither at the text level, nor at the word level. Further research could focus on other language combinations, but also on a longer time span of intervention and other linguistic factors, such as unknown vowels.},

The focus is on the distinction between statistical significance and substantive, sociological significance. We review all articles published in the European Sociological Review between 2000â2004 and 2010â2014 that use regression models (N = 356). Our main aim is to determine whether the authors discuss the effect size of their findings and distinguish substantive from statistical significance. We apply a five-item questionnaire to each article and find that about half of the articles erroneously interpret a statistically insignificant coefficient as a zero effect, while only one in three engage in a discussion of the substantive meaning of the effect sizes. Moreover, our findings show a negative trend in the practice of significance testing over the past 15 years. These results are similar to those of the comparable review in the field of economics. We conclude by providing a set of recommendations on how to reduce the misuse of significance testing in sociological research, through an informed benchmarking of the findings.},

  Abstract                 = {Most researchers agree on the idea that multilinguals have specific advantages over monolinguals in learning more languages and, more generally, develop specific competencies for expanding and managing their multilingual repertoire. Of particular interest, most notably in the context of the European strive for the upward revaluation of smaller, less used languages, is the development of receptive competences in several genetically closely related languages (cf. e.g. the EuroCom-projects). This contribution presents empirical evidence that, on the one hand, seems to support the claim that multilinguals are more efficient in developing receptive competences in new, previously unlearnt languages. The article focuses on the question how multilinguals use their languages in order to guess the meaning of cognates in unlearnt but genealogically close languages. A series of studies is discussed whose aim is to tap into this process of interlingual inferencing. Different measures for phonological and graphematic distances across languages are established and correlated with rates of successful cognate recognition in the search of a threshold of string similarity beyond which recognition becomes unlikely. The role of different types of the participants' multilingual repertoires is assessed, and other factors influencing good performance in cognate recognition are identified. The process of interlingual inferencing is discussed as a form of abductive reasoning, and quantitative and qualitative data are analyzed to support the idea that this type of abduction is an essential driving force in receptive multilingualism and language comprehension in general.},

On the one hand, names or other background information is well known to influence teachers and other gatekeepers’ evaluations, and on the other hand, code-switching and other non-standard features in pupils’ language production are also known to affect assessment outcomes not only of linguistic skills but also of general academic potential. Taking into account these two research traditions, this study investigates the influence of different ethnically marked names and code-switches on teachers’ evaluations of pupils’ oral proficiency in French as a foreign language. Three authentic oral texts were rerecorded once by inserting German words and once without such inserts. Additionally, these samples were presented either as stemming from a bilingual Swiss German native or from a multilingual Swiss-German Serbian boy. A total of 157 future teachers rated the speech samples with respect to different dimensions (fluency, correctness, but also the pupil’s academic potential in general). The analyses provide evidence for positive and negative stereotyping of the Serbian first name, and there is also an unexpected interaction with code-mixing into German: without insertional mixing, the texts with a Balkan name are perceived as being superior, but with such mixing this superiority is lost and turns into significantly lower assessment scores.},

The authors of a large number of journal articles, chapters, cognitive psychology textbooks, and books devoted to reading processes have concluded that suppression interferes with phonological recoding in print and have used this supposed fact as a basis for determining when phonology is involved in various reading tasks. Others have concluded that suppression need not interfere with phonological recoding (e.g. Besner, Davies and Daniels, 1981; Besner and Davelaar, 1982). The present review concludes that a phonological code can be derived from printed English and used for lexical access without interference from suppression. However, operations performed upon a phonological code---e.g. post-assembly phonemic segmentation and deletion, maintenance in working memory---are disrupted by suppression. A review of the literature supports this distinction; some implications of these views are noted.},

As evidence, they report a study in which a small group of monolingual and bilingual 6- and 7-year olds performed similarly on a Simon task. The present paper points to weaknesses in their experimental design, analysis, and logic that together undermine their criticism of the conclusion that bilingualism is responsible for the reported group differences.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper summarizes research showing that bilingualism affects linguistic and cognitive performance across the lifespan. The effect on linguistic performance is generally seen as a deficit in which bilingual children control a smaller vocabulary than their monolingual peers and bilingual adults perform more poorly on rapid lexical retrieval tasks. The effect on cognitive performance is to enhance executive functioning and to protect against the decline of executive control in aging. These effects interact to produce a complex pattern regarding the effect of bilingualism on memory performance. Memory tasks based primarily on verbal recall are performed more poorly by bilinguals but memory tasks based primarily on executive control are performed better by bilinguals. Speculations regarding the mechanism responsible for these effects are described.},

Bilingual Cantonese-English, bilingual French-English, and monolingual English speakers, performed the Simon task in the MEG. Reaction times were faster for congruent than for incongruent trials, and the Cantonese group was faster than the other two groups, which did not differ from each other. Analyses of the MEG data using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) and partial last squares (PLS) showed that the same pattern of activity, involving signal changes in left and medial prefrontal areas, characterized all three groups. Correlations between activated regions and reaction times, however, showed that the two bilingual groups demonstrated faster reaction times with greater activity in superior and middle temporal, cingulate, and superior and inferior frontal regions, largely in the left hemisphere. The monolinguals demonstrated faster reaction times with activation in middle frontal regions. The interpretation is that the management of two language systems led to systematic changes in frontal executive functions.},

Bialystok, 2001). The present research attempted to determine whether this bilingual advantage persists for adults and whether bilingualism attenuates the negative effects of aging on cognitive control in older adults. Three studies are reported that compared the performance of mono-lingual and bilingual middle-aged and older adults on the Simon task. Bilingualism was associated with smaller Simon effect costs for both age groups; bilingual participants also responded more rapidly to conditions that placed greater demands on working memory. In all cases the bilingual advantage was greater for older participants. It appears, therefore, that controlled processing is carried out more effectively by bilinguals and that bilingualism helps to offset age-related losses in certain executive processes.},

Younger participants performed most of the tasks better than older participants, confirming the effect of aging on these processes. The effect of language group was different for each type of task: Monolinguals and bilinguals performed similarly on working memory tasks, monolinguals performed better on lexical retrieval tasks, and bilinguals performed better on executive control tasks, with some evidence for larger language group differences in older participants on the executive control tasks. These results replicate findings from individual studies obtained using only 1 type of task and different participants. The confirmation of this pattern in the same participants is discussed in terms of a suggested explanation of how the need to manage 2 language systems leads to these different outcomes for cognitive and linguistic functions.},

The results showed that bilinguals performed better than monolinguals in early childhood, adulthood, and later adulthood.

Performance was measured for both accuracy of judgement and time taken to respond. The results showed that performance patterns were different for the two learner groups, that the linguistic structure tested in the item affected participants' ability to respond correctly, and that task modality produced reliable response differences for the two learner groups. Although there were proficiency differences in the grammaticality judgement task between the younger and older Spanish learners, there were no such differences for the Chinese group. Furthermore, age of learning influence achieved proficiency through all ages tested rather than defining a point of critical period. The results are interpreted as failing to provide sufficient evidence to accept the hypothesis that there is a critical period for second language acquisition.},

  Abstract                 = {Second-language (L2) acquisition is generally thought to be constrained by maturational factors that circumscribe a critical period for nativelike attainment. Consistent with the maturational view are age effects among learners who begin L2 acquisition prior to, but not after, closure of the putative critical period. Also favoring the maturational account is the scarcity of late L2 learners at asymptote who perform like natives, and weak effects of native language-target language pairings. With Korean and Chinese learners of English, the experimental study of Johnson and Newport (1989) yielded just these types of evidence. Some subsequent studies do not support the critical period account of L2 acquisition constraints, however. Accordingly, we undertook a replication of Johnson and Newport (1989), using the exact methods and materials of the original experiment, and a sample of Spanish natives (n = 61). In keeping with recent research, L2 attainment negatively correlates with age of learning even if learning commences after the presumed end of the critical period. We also find modest evidence of nativelike attainment among late learners. Our data further suggest that the outcome of L2 acquisition may depend on L1-L2 pairings and L2 use.},

A survey of foreign language students on progress in foreign language learning revealed that many students were not unduly influenced by their scores on internationally recognized language tests when they assessed their own language level. If the international test scores are an accurate reflection of linguistic ability, then it would seem that self-ratings of language ability at the beginning of the pre-sessional course cannot be relied upon. Nine questionnaires completed in post-course evaluations indicated that there was not a very good match between the teachers' assessments and the students' assessments at the end of the pre-sessional course and two terms later. It is concluded that self-assessment for students appears to involve great difficulty, even with teacher feedback. Yet, evidence was fou},

The present study is aimed at investigating age-related changes in these mechanisms across the adult life-span from 20 to 86 years of age. Results indicate a linear relationship between each working memory measure and age, independently of the nature of the task, and a quadratic relationship between the single inhibitory measures and age. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses show that inhibition accounts for a significant, but modest, part of the age-related variance in working memory. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition is not as crucial a contributor of age-related changes in the functional capacity of working memory across the adult life-span as previously thought.},

Theoretical accounts of the Simon effect typically explain performance in terms of automatic and controlled processes. Furthermore, the relative contributions of automatic and controlled processes are held to change as a function of the proportion of compatible to incompatible trials (compatibility proportion). Data are presented demonstrating that the reliability of the Simon effect, indexed by correlating its magnitude within subjects across blocks of trials, varied substantially as a function of the compatibility proportion. When the compatibility proportion was high, so was reliability. When the compatibility proportion was low, reliability was low as well. The results are discussed in terms of the relative reliability of automatic and controlled processes and the role of working memory and attentional control in goal maintenance.},

Experiment 1 investigated talker-dependent adaptation by comparing native English listeners’ recognition accuracy for Chinese-accented English across single and multiple talker presentation conditions. Results showed that the native listeners adapted to the foreign-accented speech over the course of the single talker presentation condition with some variation in the rate and extent of this adaptation depending on the baseline sentence intelligibility of the foreign-accented talker. Experiment 2 investigated talker-independent perceptual adaptation to Chinese-accented English by exposing native English listeners to Chinese-accented English and then testing their perception of English produced by a novel Chinese-accented talker. Results showed that, if exposed to multiple talkers of Chinese-accented English during training, native English listeners could achieve talker-independent adaptation to Chinese-accented English. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for highly flexible speech perception processes that can adapt to speech that deviates substantially from the pronunciation norms in the native talker community along multiple acoustic-phonetic dimensions.},

The theory postulates that this neural mechanism is integral to the representation, maintenance and updating of context information, and as such impacts cognitive control across a wide range of cognitive domains, including working memory, attention, and inhibition. Behavioral and brain imaging data in support of the theory are discussed, which demonstrate selective impairments in context processing among healthy older adults associated with abnormal PFC activation. These findings highlight the utility of a computational approach to cognitive aging. Current directions for further refinement and validation of the model are outlined.},

Due to their common ancestral bond of Latin, Spanish and English share many cognates, including some that are highly frequent in Spanish but less frequent in English, specifically in science text. Consequently, Spanish/English bilinguals possess a linguistic resource that includes many words that, while commonplace in Spanish (e.g., enfermo), are reserved for scientific and academic registers in English (e.g., infirm). For first language Spanish students these words might well aid in accessing core English words and understandings of science texts. An analysis of the frequency of key vocabulary in three science units revealed a substantial number of these frequency-imbalanced cognate pairs; that is, the Spanish member has a higher frequency than the English counterpart.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treat the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed tot the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from the exclusive dependence on data models and adpot a more diverse set of tools.},

Properties of the VSSP were investigated by means of the usual dual-task paradigm (to search for interference from the other components of working memory, i.e., the articulatory loop and the central executive), applied to three distinct subprocesses of mental imagery (Kosslyn, 1994 Image and Brain. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA): image generation (Experiment 1), image maintenance (Experiment 2), and image rotation (Experiment 3). First, in the control condition (no interference task) of each experiment, we replicated the effects of stimulus or task complexity already reported. Second, no interference from the articulatory loop was observed. Third, maintenance of images appeared free from any interference. And fourth, generation and rotation tasks were interfered to a greater extent by the central executive than by the involvement of the VSSP in a secondary task. These observations (a) support the dissociation between the articulatory loop and the VSSP, (b) suggest an important use of central attentional resources in the generation and rotation of mental images, (c) would support the distinction between visual and spatial components in the structure of working memory, and (d) suggest the dissociation of the VSSP into two subcomponents: a passive visuospatial store and an active device for recapitulating visuospatial information.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple-choice tests are often scored by formulas under which the respondent's expected score for an item is the same whether he or she omits it or guesses at random. Typically, these formulas are accompanied by instructions that discourage guessing. In this article, we look at test taking from the normative and descriptive perspectives of judgment and decision theory. We show that for a rational test taker, whose goal is the maximalization of expected score, answering is either superior or equivalent to omitting---a fact which follows from the scoring formula. For test takers who are not fully rational, or have goals other than the maximalization of expected score, it is very hard to give adequate formula scoring instructions, and even the recommendation to answer under partial knowledge is problematic (though generally beneficial). Our analysis derives from a critical look at standard assumptions about the epistemic states, response strategies, and strategic motivations of test takers. In conclusion, we endorese the number-right scoring rule, which discourages omissions and is robust against variability in respondent motivations, limitations in judgments of uncertainty, and item vagaries.},

Therefore, 20 working memory tests, 2 attention tests, and 18 intelligence subtests were administered to 121 students. We were able to replicate results indicating that storage in the context of processing and coordination are significant predictors of reasoning. Controlling for crystallized intelligence did not decrease the common variance between working memory and reasoning. The study also revealed that the factors coordination and sustained attention were highly correlated. Finally, a model is presented with the latent variables speed and g, which can explain almost all of the common variance of the applied aggregates. A detailed discussion of the results supports the view that working memory and intelligence share about 70% of the common variance.},

Nine hundred thirty-eight participants aged 20 to 89 years completed an abbreviated Stroop color-naming task and a subset of 281 participants also completed card-sorting, simple reaction time, and choice reaction time tasks. Age-related increases in incongruent color-naming latency and card-sorting perseverative errors were observed. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the processing speed measures accounted for significant variance on both dependent measures, but that there was also a significant residual effect of age. An additional regression analysis showed that some of the variance in incongruent color-naming, after controlling for processing speed, was shared with the variance in perseverative errors. Overall, findings suggest that the age difference in Stroop interference is partially attributable to general slowing, but is also attributable to age-related changes in task-specific processes such as inhibitory control.},

The review focuses on language comprehension and production, domains of cognition vulnerable to age-linked inhibitory deficits under the theory. Considerable research, however, reports remarkable age constancy in many aspects of language performance, contrary to the predictions of Inhibitory Deficit theory. For conditions that do produce age differences in language comprehension and production, evidence for inhibitory deficits is controversial at best. In predicting new findings, Inhibitory Deficit theory is constrained by lack of a well specified model, producing confusion between inhibition that occurs at a behavioral level versus a theoretical level. Modification of the theory is required to bring it in line with empirical findings on language and aging, and greater specification of underlying processes is required to reduce contradictions in predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE:

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of initial first and second language proficiencies as well as the language of instruction that a student receives on the relationship between native language ability of students who are English language learners (ELLs) and their development of early literacy skills and the second language.
METHOD:

This study investigated the development of early language and literacy skills among Spanish-speaking students in 2 large urban school districts, 1 middle-size urban district, and 1 border district. A total of 1,016 ELLs in kindergarten participated in the study. Students were administered a comprehensive battery of tests in English and Spanish, and classroom observations provided information regarding the Spanish or English language use of the teacher.
RESULTS:

Findings from this study suggest that Spanish-speaking students with high Spanish letter name and sound knowledge tend to show high levels of English letter name and sound knowledge. ELLs with low Spanish and English letter name and sound knowledge tend to show high levels of English letter name and sound knowledge when they are instructed in English. Letter name and sound identification skills are fairly highly positively correlated across languages in the beginning of the kindergarten year. In addition, phonological awareness skills appear to be the area with the most significant and direct transfer of knowledge, and language skills do not appear to be a factor in the development of phonological awareness. Finally, the relationship between oral language skills across languages was low, suggesting little relationship between oral language skills across languages at the beginning of the kindergarten year.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:

Results from this study suggest that pedagogical decisions for ELLs should not only consider effective instructional literacy strategies but also acknowledge that the language of instruction for Spanish-speaking ELLs may produce varying results for different students.},

  Abstract                 = {Bilinguals appear to have shared syntactic representations for similar constructions between languages but retain distinct representations for noncognate translation-equivalents (Schoonbaert, Hartsuiker, & Pickering, 2007). We inquire whether bilinguals have more integrated represtations of cognate translation-equivalents. To investigate this, we report two structural priming experiments in which participants heard dative sentences in Mandarin or Cantonese and described pictures using Mandarin (Experiment 1) or Cantonese (Experiment 2). We found that cognate verbs between the prime and the target led to a smaller boost than same verbs. This difference in priming could not be attributed to more phonological overlap between same verbs (i.e., identical) than between cognate verbs (i.e., similar but not identical). These results suggest that cognate verbs have separate rather than shared lemma representations across languages, even though their associated syntactic information appears to be collectively represented. Furthermore, we found an advantage for within-language priming over between-language priming. We interpreted this advantage as the result of a language node passing activation to all the lemmas linked to it. Implications for bilingul lexical and syntactic representation and processing are discussed.},

Two groups of 15 seven- to eight-year olds participated : children with normally develop- ing reading comprehension skill and children with weak reading com- prehension skill. The children read short stories containing a novel word and were required to produce a meaning for the novel word, both before and after its useful defining context. The proximity of the novel word to this context was manipulated. The results supported the hypothesis that children with weak reading comprehension skills are impaired in their ability to integrate information within a text, particularly when that information is non-adjacent and the processing demands are, therefore, high. Analysis of the error data revealed a similar pattern of types of errors for both groups : children with poor reading comprehension were not more likely to produce a thematically inappropriate response than their skilled peers.},

  Abstract                 = {Gaps in reading performance between Anglo and Latino children are associated with gaps in vocabulary knowledge. An intervention was designed to enhance fifth graders' academic vocabulary. The meanings of academically useful words were taught together with strategies for using information from context, from morphology, from knowledge about multiple meanings, and from cognates to infer word meaning. Among the principles underlying the intervention were that new words should be encountered in meaningful texxt, that native Spanish speakers should have access to the text's meaning through Spanish, that words should be encountered in varying contexts, and that word knowledge involves spelling, pronunciation, morphology, and syntax as well as depth of meaning. Fifth graders in the intervention group showed greater growth than the comparison group on knowledge of the words taught, on depth of vocabulary knowledge, on understanding multiple meanings, and on reading comprehension. The intervention effects were as large for the English-language learniners (ELLs) as for the English-only speakers (EOs), though the ELLs scored lower on all pre- and posttest measures. The results show the feasibility of improving comprehension outcomes for students in mixed ELL-EO classes, by teaching word analysis and vocabulary learning strategies.},

Matching large groups of items or participants on multiple dimensions is a difficult and time-consuming task, yet failure to match conditions will lead to suboptimal experi - ments. We describe a computer program, ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂMatch,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ that automates this process by selecting the best-matching items from larger sets of candidate items. In most cases, the program produces near-optimal solutions in a matter of minutes and selects matches that are typically superior to those obtained using hand matching or other semi - automated processes. We report the results of a case study in which Match was used to generate matched sets of experimental items (words varying in length and frequency) for a published study on language processing. The program was able to come up with better-matching item sets than those hand-selected by the authors of the original study, and in a fraction of the time originally taken up with stimulus matching.},

  Abstract                 = {We argue that mutual intelligibility testing is an adequate way to determine how different two languages or language varieties are. We tested the mutual intelligibility of 15 Chinese dialects functionally at the level of isolated words (word-intelligibility) and the level of sentences (sentence intelligibility).We collected data for each dialect by playing isolated words and sentences spoken in 15 Chinese dialects to 15 listeners. Word-intelligibility was determined by having listeners perform a semantic categorization task whereby words had to be classified as one of ten different categories such as body part, plant, animal, etc. Sentence intelligibility was estimated by having the listeners translate a target word in each sentence into their own dialect. We obtained 47,250 data (15  150  15 for the word part and 15  60  15 for the sentence part).We also had at our disposal structural similarity measures (lexical similarity, phonological correspondence) for each pair of the 15 Chinese dialects published by Cheng (Computational Linguistics&Chinese Language Processing 1997, 2.1, pp. 41ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ72). Our general conclusion is that the degree of mutual intelligibility can be determined by both opinion and functional tests. These two subjective measures are significantly correlated with one another and can be predicted from objective measures (lexical similarity and phonological correspondence) equally well. However, functional intelligibility measures, especially at the sentence level, better reflect Chinese dialect classifications than opinion scores.},

  Abstract                 = {Background The use of structural equation modeling and latent variables remains uncommon in epidemiology despite its potential usefulness. The latter was illustrated by studying cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between eating behavior and adiposity, using four different indicators of fat mass. Methods Using data from a longitudinal community-based study, we fitted structural equation models including two latent variables (respectively baseline adiposity and adiposity change after 2 years of follow-up), each being defined, by the four following anthropometric measurement (respectively by their changes): body mass index, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and percent body fat. Latent adiposity variables were hypothesized to depend on a cognitive restraint score, calculated from answers to an eating-behavior questionnaire (TFEQ-18), either cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Results We found that high baseline adiposity was associated with a 2-year increase of the cognitive restraint score and no convincing relationship between baseline cognitive restraint and 2-year adiposity change could be established. Conclusions The latent variable modeling approach enabled presentation of synthetic results rather than separate regression models and detailed analysis of the causal effects of interest. In the general population, restrained eating appears to be an adaptive response of subjects prone to gaining weight more than as a risk factor for fat-mass increase.},

Very few researchers, however, have examined life-span changes in this ability in single studies. Within this life-span context, we investigated 1 type of inhibitory control -- the ability to inhibit a prepotent response and generate an incompatible response -- in individuals ranging from 6 to 82 years of age. Examination of raw reaction time data revealed a significantly larger inhibitory control effect for children and older adults than for young adults. Using proportional and z score transformations, we demonstrated that a processing speed explanation is sufficient to account for differences between children and young adults; this explanation, however, did not adequately explain the discrepancy between young and older adults. Taken together, these findings suggest that, above and beyond differences in processing speed, inhibitory control was less efficient in older adults. Our findings are consistent with the assertion that inhibitory control develops quite early and declines at the later end of the developmental spectrum.},

  abstract  = {When experimental designs are premature, impractical, or impossible, researchers must rely on statistical methods to adjust for potentially confounding effects. Such procedures, however, are quite fallible. We examine several errors that often follow the use of statistical adjustment. The first is inferring a factor is causal because it predicts an outcome even after "statistical control" for other factors. This inference is fallacious when (as usual) such control involves removing the linear contribution of imperfectly measures variables, or when some confounders remain unmeasured. The converse fallicy is inferring a factor is not causally important because its association with the outcome is attenuated or eliminated by the inclusion of covariates in the adjustment process. This attentuation may only reflect that the covariates treated as confounders are actually mediators (intermediates) and critical to the causal chain from the study factro to the study outcome. Other problems arise due to mismeasurement of the study factor or outcome, or becaue these study variables are only proxies for underlying constructs. Statistical adjustment serves a useful function, but it cannot transform observational studies into natural experiments, and involves far more subjctive judgment than many users realize.},

In so doing, it is argued, they are committing the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, which can lead to serious error. The problem is illustrated for one well-known series of studies in semantic memory. With the appropriate statistics these studies are shown to provide no reliable evidence for most of the main conclusions drawn from them. A review of other experiments in semantic memory shows that many of them are likewise suspect. It is demonstrated how this fallacy can be avoided by doing the right statistics, selecting the appropriate design, and sampling by systematic procedures, or, alternatively, by proceeding according to the so-called method of single cases.},

Some display methods lead to efficient, accurate visual decoding of en- coded information, and others lead to inefficient, inaccurate decoding. It is only through rigorous studies of visual decoding that informed judgments can be made about how to choose display methods. A model has been developed to provide a framework for the study of visual decoding. The model consists of three parts: (1) a two-way classification of information on displays-quantitative-scale, quantitative-physical, categorical-scale, and categorical-physical; (2) a division of the visual processing of graphical displays into pattern perception and table look-up; (3) a specification of visual operations that are employed to carry out pattern perception and table look-up. Display methods are assessed by studying the visual operations to which they lead. Studies use the theory and experimental technique of various areas of vision research including psychophysics, cognitive psychology, and computational vision. This process is illustrated by studies of three display methods: visual reference grids for graphs with juxtaposed panels and common scales, encoding a categorical variable on a scatterplot by the type of plotting symbol, and choosing the aspect ratio of a factor-response graph.},

Two general varieties of theoretical models are considered: models in which the time-related change of primary interest is continuous, and those in which it is characterized by movement between discrete states. In addition, two general types of temporal designs are considered: the longitudinal panel design and the intensive longitudinal design. For each general category of theoretical models, some of the analytic possibilities available for longitudinal panel designs and for intensive longitudinal designs are discussed. The article concludes with brief discussions of two issues particularly relevant to longitudinal research--missing data and measurement--and a few words about exploratory research.},

It is shown that for a study of a given duration, if observations are spaced too far apart the resulting data can support misleading conclusions, whereas if observations are spaced relatively close together, a much more veridical picture of the process of interest is provided. The application of these ideas in several areas is discussed, including correlation and regression analysis where a variable measured at one time is used to predict a variable measured at a later time; growth curve analyses; and analyses involving stage-sequential processes. We argue that longitudinal designs should relate the choice of timing and spacing of observations in longitudinal studies to characteristics of the processes being measured. In addition, consideration of the possible effects of measurement design on results of statistical analyses may aid in their interpretation. New approaches involving intensive data collection with much shorter measurement intervals, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment, are promising, but are costly and are not suitable for every research question. More information is needed to help guide researchers in their choice of temporal design},

Hundreds of studies have addressed this issue by measuring intelligence, basic cognitive processes, or personality. However, the simultaneous consideration of a broad and varied array of measures is much less common. Here we consider several cognitive and personality measures concurrently to define latent factors representing six constructs of presumed interest: fluid intelligence, short-term memory, working memory, processing speed, controlled attention, and temperament difficulties. One hundred and thirty-five secondary school students were tested. Their academic performance was measured by average grades in the nine scholastic areas of their curriculum. The main finding shows that a latent factor defined by fluid intelligence and memory span along with a latent factor defined by impulsiveness, sensation seeking, and lack of fear account for an impressive figure of 60% of the variance in academic performance.},

A modified form of the Stroop color-word test was used. This test consisted of 3 tasks: (a) reading of 100 color words (red, blue, and green) printed in black ink, (b) naming 100 rectangular patches of color (red, blue, and green), (c) naming the color of the ink in which 100 color-words (red, blue and green) were printed, but where the actual color of the ink was different from the color designated by the word. The critical part of the test (c) involved interference of word reading with color naming. The Stroop test was administered to a total of 235 Ss ranging from 7 to 80 years of age. It was found that the degree of interference of color-words on color naming is greatest with young children, decreases with increasing age to adulthood, and increases again with older ages. These changes with age were interpreted in terms of comparative-developmental theory.},

Structural equation modeling was then performed to determine which construct served as the best predictor of general fluid intelligence. The results suggest that WMC, but not short-term memory capacity or processing speed, is a good predictor of general fluid intelligence in young adults.

  Abstract                 = {The term multicompetence describes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthe compound state of a mind with two grammarsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ (Cook, 1991a, p. 112). This paper reviews evidence addressing two questions: 1. Do people who know two languages differ from people who know only one in other respects than simply knowledge of an L2? L2 users differ from monolinguals in L1 knowledge; advanced L2 users differ from monolinguals in L2 knowledge; L2 users have a different metalinguistic awareness from monolinguals; L2 users have different cognitive processes. These subtle differences consistently suggest that people with multicompetence are not simply equivalent to two monolinguals but are a unique combination. 2. Do people who know two languages have a merged language system rather than two separate systems? The L1 and L2 share the same mental lexicon; L2 users code switch readily; L2 processing cannot be cut off from LI; both languages are stored in the same areas of the brain; L2 proficiency relates to L1 proficiency. This evidence suggests merged systems at some level in some areas, even if some of it is open to other interpretations. A final section discusses more general issues. Much SLA research is biased by adopting the monolingual as a norm rather than the multicompetent speaker. Multicompetence distinguishes diachronic transfer during the learner's acquisition from synchronic transfer between the two languages at a single moment of time. Multicompetence starts when there is systematic knowledge of an L2 that is not assimilated to the L1. Holistic multicompetence is seen as an offshoot of polylectal grammar theory applied to monolinguals. Language teaching should try to produce multicompetent individuals not ersatz native speakers.},

The results of Experiment 1 fully supported these predictions. In Experiment 2, the difference between cognate and noncognate words was larger when naming in the nondominant language than when naming in the dominant language.

In particular, we focus on the origin of the bilingual advantage on overall reaction times in the flanker task. Bilingual and monolingual participants were asked to perform a flanker task under different task versions. In Experiment 1, we used two low monitoring versions where most of the trials were of just one type (either congruent or incongruent). In Experiment 2, we used two high-monitoring versions where congruent and incongruent trials were more evenly distributed. An effect of bilingualism in overall reaction times was only present in the high-monitoring condition. These results reveal that when the task at hand recruits a good deal of monitoring resources, bilinguals outperform monolinguals. This observation suggests that bilingualism may affect the monitoring processes involved in executive control.},

Tests of fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, short-term memory and perceptual discrimination were given to 97 subjects between the ages of 17 and 85 years. For each test item subjects gave their best answer, rated their confidence that the item was correct, and decided whether to submit the item for scoring. Previously used measures describing different aspects of subjects' confidence judgements (overconfidence, calibration, resolution and slope) were also calculated for each subject on each of the tests. As expected, older people performed less well on traditional measures of fluid intelligence and short-term memory, but better than younger subjects on measures of crystallized intelligence. Older subjects responded more slowly to test items for all types of tasks. Regarding the confidence judgement measures, older subject showed a consistent tendency towards greater overconfidence compared to younger subjects. Older people also showed consistently worse performance on the resolution and slope scores, which measure the ability of the subject's confidence judgements to discriminate between correct and incorrect answers.},

In this paper, we examine work on the perception of accented speech across the lifespan, from early infancy to late adulthood. Unfamiliar accents initially impair linguistic processing by infants, children, younger adults, and older adults, but listeners of all ages come to adapt to accented speech. Emergent research also goes beyond these perceptual abilities, by assessing links with production and the relative contributions of linguistic knowledge and general cognitive skills. We conclude by underlining points of convergence across ages, and the gaps left to face in future work.},

The purpose of the study is to examine relationships between analytic scores of depth of lexical knowledge, breadth of lexical knowledge, and access to core lexical items and holistic scores of lexical proficiency. A corpus of 240 spoken texts and 240 written texts produced by beginning L2 learners, intermediate L2 learners, advanced L2 learners, and native speakers were scored for both analytic and holistic features of lexical proficiency by trained raters. Using a multiple regression analysis, the study found that collocation accuracy, lexical diversity, and word frequency are significant predictors of human evaluations of lexical proficiency. Collocation accuracy explained the greatest amount of variance in the holistic scores (84% in the written samples and 89% in the spoken samples). The authors discuss the importance of collocation accuracy in predicting human judgments of lexical proficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Replication is fundamental to science, so statistical analysis should give information about replication. Because p values dominate statistical analysis in psychology, it is important to ask what p says about replication. The answer to this question is ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂSurprisingly little.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ In one simulation of 25 repetitions of a typical experiment, p varied from <.001 to .76, thus illustrating that p is a very unreliable measure. This article shows that, if an initial experiment results in two-tailed p 5 .05, there is an 80% chance the one-tailed p value from a replication will fall in the interval (.00008, .44), a 10% chance that p < .00008, and fully a 10% chance that p > .44. Remarkably, the intervalÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtermed a p intervalÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂis this wide however large the sample size. p is so unreliable and gives such dramat- ically vague information that it is a poor basis for inference. Confidence intervals, however, give much better information about replication. Researchers should minimize the role of p by using confidence intervals and model- fitting techniques and by adopting meta-analytic thinking.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The papers in this special issue of of International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism edited by Shelley K. Taylor and Mitsuyo Sakamoto cover a wide range of educational contexts and issues and they draw on a variety of disciplinary perspectives to interpret the phenomena they analyze. As the editors point out in their introduction, the common thread linking these analyses is the intersection between language and power. In some contexts, minority communities are the victims of overt violence exercised either by racist groups within society. In other cases, coercive power operates through discourses that position individuals and groups in subordinated relationships. The papers by Lee and Norton, and Morgan all analyze how individuals and/or educators can challenge coercive relations of power operating through these discourses to re-position themselves as agents in their own identity formation. The disciplinary focus shifts in Mayer's paper to address the psycholinguistic challenges faced by Deaf and hard-of-hearing students in appropriating the academic language competencies (in both first and second languages) necessary for school success. Although the primary focus in these papers is on psycholinguistic and pedagogical issues, societal power relations are never far from the surface. The devaluation of community languages (e.g. American Sign Language in the case of the Deaf community) in the wider society results in ambivalence among parents and educators about whether these languages should be strongly supported in home and school.},

They also did a 20-item SpanishÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂEnglish Cognate Test (SECT), similar to PPVT, on recognizing low-frequency English words with high-frequency Spanish cognates. The CAT and conventionally scored PPVT revealed comparable verbal ability between groups, but on 60 consecutive PPVT items, immersion did better than control (p = .002) because of cognates. On SECT, immersion significantly outperformed control (p < .001; effect sizes: 5th grade = 1.72, 6th grade = 1.45). Findings support the idea that Spanish immersion has English-language benefits and that positive transfer (crosslinguistic influence) occurs from Spanish as a foreign language to native English receptive vocabulary.},

  Abstract                 = {The processes by which listeners recognize spoken language are highly language-specific. Listeners' expectations of how meaning is expressed in words and sentences are formed by the lexicon and grammar of the native language; but the phonology plays an even more immediate role. Thus the native phoneme repertoire constrains listeners' ability to discriminate phonetic contrasts; and a further area in which such constraints arise is the segmentation of continuous speech into its components. A large body of research is summarised here, motivating three conclusions: (1) In segmenting speech, speakers of different languages apply different heuristic procedures, efficiently exploiting the specific phonological structure of their various languages. (2) These procedures have become part of the listeners' processing system, to an extent that they are also applied when listenings to nonnative languages, even though this may lead to inefficiency. (3) It may be impossible to acquire the use of multiple procedures of this kind; but it is possible to inhibit the misapplication of native procedures to other languages for which they are inefficient.},

  Abstract                 = {Languages differ in the constitution of their phonemic repertoire and in the relative distinctiveness of phonemes within the repertoire. In the present study, we asked whether such differences constrain spoken-word recognition, via two word reconstruction experiments, in which listeners turned nonwords into real words by changing single sounds. The experiments were carried out i Dutch (which has a relatively balanced vowel--consonant ratio and many similar vowels) and in Spanish (which has many more consonants than vowels and high distinctiveness among the vowels). Both Dutch and Spanish listeners responsed significantly faster and more accurately when required to change vowels as opposed to consonants; when allowed to change any phoneme, they more often altered vowels than consonants. Vowel information thus appears to constrain lexical selection less tightly (allow more potential candidates) than does consonant information, independent of language-specific phoneme repertoire ad of relative distinctiveness of vowels.},

  Abstract                 = {The phoneme detection task is widely used in spoken-word recognition research. Alphabetically literate participants, however, are more used to explicit representations of letters than of phonemes. The present study explored whether phoneme detection is sensitive to how target phonemes are, or may be, orthographically realized. Listeners detected the target sounds [b, m, t, f, s, k] in word-initial position in sequences of isolated English words. Response times were faster to the targets [b, m, t], which have consistent word-initial spelling, than to the targets [f, s, k], which are inconsistently spelled, but only when spelling was rendered salient by the presence in the experiment of many irregularly spelled filler words. Within the inconsistent targets [f, s, k], there was no significant difference between responses to targets in words with more usual (foam, seed, cattle) versus less usual (phone , cede, kettle) spellings. Phoneme detection is thus not necessarily sensitive to orthographic effects; knowledge of spelling stored in the lexical representations of words does not automatically become available as word candidates are activated. However, salient orthographic manipulations in experimental input can induce such sensitivity. We attribute this to listenersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ experience of the value of spelling in everyday situations that encourage phonemic decisions (such as learning new names).},

  Abstract                 = {This study was designed to test the Fundamental Difference Hypothesis (Bley-Vroman, 1988), which states that, whereas children are known to learn language almost completely through (implicit) domain-specific mechanisms, adults have largely lost the ability to learn a language without reflecting on its structure and have to use alternative mechanisms, drawing especially on their problem-solving capacities, to learn a second language. The hypothesis implies that only adults with a high level of verbal analytical ability will reach near-native competence in their second language, but that this ability will not be a significant predictor of success for childhood second language acquisition. A study with 57 adult Hungarian-speaking immigrants confirmed the hypothesis in the sense that very few adult immigrants scored within the range of child arrivals ona grammaticality judgment test, and that the few who did had high levels of verbal analytical ability; this ability was not a significant preditor for childhood arrivals. This study replicates the findings of Johnson and Newport (1989) and provides an explanation for the apparent exceptions in their study. These findings lead to a reconceptualization of the Critical Period Hypothesis: If the scope of this hypothesis is limited to implicit learning mechanisms, then it appears that there may be no exceptions to the age effects that the hypothesis seeks to explain.},

A primary goal of the meta-analysis was to compare the predictive power of the measures of working memory developed by Daneman and Carpenter (1980) with the predictive power of other measures of working memory. The results of the meta-analysis support Daneman and Carpenter's (1980) claim that measures that tap the combined processing and storage capacity of working memory (e.g., reading span, listening span) are better predictors of comprehension than are measures that tap only the storage capacity (e.g., word span, digit span). The meta-analysis also showed that math process plus storage measures of working memory are good predictors of comprehension. Thus, the superior predictive power of the process plus storage measures is not limited to measures that involve the manipulation of words and sentences.},

  abstract = {Abstract Adrianus Dingeman de Groot (1914ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ2006) was one of the most influential Dutch psychologists. He became famous for his work ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂThought and Choice in ChessÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ, but his main contribution was methodological ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ De Groot co-founded the Department of Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam (together with R. F. van Naerssen), founded one of the leading testing and assessment companies (CITO), and wrote the monograph ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂMethodologyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ that centers on the empirical-scientific cycle: observationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinductionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂdeductionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtestingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂevaluation. Here we translate one of De Groot's early articles, published in 1956 in the Dutch journal Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Psychologie en Haar Grensgebieden. This article is more topical now than it was almost 60 years ago. De Groot stresses the difference between exploratory and confirmatory (ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂhypothesis testingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ) research and argues that statistical inference is only sensible for the latter: ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂOne ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂis allowedÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to apply statistical tests in exploratory research, just as long as one realizes that they do not have evidential impactÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. De Groot may have also been one of the first psychologists to argue explicitly for preregistration of experiments and the associated plan of statistical analysis. The appendix provides annotations that connect De Groot's arguments to the current-day debate on transparency and reproducibility in psychological science.},

pronomina te verwijzen naar alle substantieven met een telbare referent, en met een neuter pronomen
naar substantieven met een niet-telbare referent (Audring 2006). In dit artikel worden enkele aspecten
besproken van het pronominale genus, meer bepaald op de rol die het grammaticale genus nog speelt

masculinisering en/of hersemantisering. We zoomen daarvoor in op het pronominale genus zoals dat
verworven wordt door zuidelijk Nederlandse kinderen, in casu zes- en zevenjarige kinderen uit de
Belgische provincie Oost-Vlaanderen. Afgaande op MillsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ (1986) bevinding dat er een verband bestaat
tussen de manier waarop een genusregel verworven wordt en de status van die regel in de taal, kunnen
de bevindingen uit dit onderzoek gebruikt worden om tot een karakterisering te komen van het
pronominale genus in het hedendaagse zuidelijke Nederlands. Het onderzoek geeft aan dat het
hedendaagse Nederlandse pronominale genus in het zuiden een hybride systeem vormt waarbinnen in
de eerste plaats het onderscheid tussen de-woorden en het-woorden van belang is. In essentie is er
dus sprake van een grammaticaal tweegenerasysteem. Daarnaast bestaat er binnen de de-woorden
een semantische tendens om met het te verwijzen naar alle woorden die niet-telbaar of abstract zijn
(ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂneutraliseringÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ).},

  Abstract                 = {Reaction time variables are used widely in studies of human cognitive ageing and in research on the information processing foundations of psychometric intelligence. The research is largely based on biased population samples. In the present study, large (500+), representative samples of the population of the West of Scotland were tested at ages 16, 36 and 56 years on simple and choice reaction time. Participants were re-tested eight years later, at which time they also took the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). We report simple and choice reaction time means and their variabilities, their stability across 8 years, and their correlations with the PASAT. Simple and choice reaction times become slower and more variable with age. Women from age 36 to 63 show more variability in choice reaction times than men, an effect which remains after controlling for mean reaction time. Reaction time differences largely account for age differences, but not sex differences, in PASAT scores.},

In a "differentiation hypothesis" originally suggested by Spearman it is hypothesized that the degree to which g pervades performance on mental tests is greater at lower ability levels. In addition to providing a critical review, the study presented here tests the differentiation hypothesis: (a) at different ability levels and ages; (b) when groups are selected on the basis of a wide range of criterion abilities; and (c) by developing new statistical techniques for sampling groups of different ability levels. Data used were the Differential Aptitude Test results of over 10,500 Irish schoolchildren aged 14 through 17 years. Of groups selected on the basis of verbal, numerical, or spatial ability, the below-average ability groups had a more pervasive g factor, confirming the differentiation hypothesis.},

Molecular genetic studies have yet to identify reliably reproducible contributions from individual genes.

General intelligence contributed to success on all 25 subjects. Variance accounted for ranged from 58.6% in Mathematics and 48% in English to 18.1% in Art and Design. Girls showed no advantage in g, but performed significantly better on all subjects except Physics. This was not due to their better verbal ability.

  abstract  = {Few researchers would doubt that ultimate attainment in second language grammar is negatively correlated with age of acquisition, but considerable controversy remains about the nature of this relationship: the exact shape of the age-attainment function and its interpretation. This article presents two parallel studies with native speakers of Russian: one on the acquisition of English as a second language in North America (n = 76) and one on the acquisition of Hebrew as a second language in Israel (n = 64). Despite the very different nature of the languages being learned, the two studies show very similar results. When age at testing is partialed out, the data reveal a steep decline in the learning of grammar before age 18 in both groups, followed by an essentially horizontal slope until age 40. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of the critical period. Both groups show a significant correlation between ultimate attainment and verbal aptitude for the adult learners, but not for the early learners. This is interpreted as further evidence that the learning processes in childhood and adulthood not only yield different levels of proficiency but are also different in nature.},

The authors modeled the age differences in simple and 4-choice reaction time means and variabilities and tested for age differences. Simple RT shows little slowing until around 50, whereas choice RT slows throughout the adult age range. The aging of choice RT variability is a function of its mean and the error rate.

Data were collected via Web-based questionnaires. Participants were divided into three groups based on their trait EI scores (low, average, high). Nonparametric statistical analyses revealed a consistent pattern of results across languages and situations. Higher levels of trait EI corresponded to significantly lower CA/FLA scores. Participants who started learning the second and third languages at a younger age also suffered less from FLA. Purely classroom-based language instruction was found to be linked to higher levels of FLA compared to instruction that also involved extracurricular use of the language. The knowledge of more languages, a higher frequency of use, a stronger socialization in a language, a larger network of interlocutors, and a higher level of self-perceived proficiency in a language were also linked to lower levels of CA/FLA.},

In a large-scale analysis of English word identification we find that group-level differences are fully accounted for by the individual language proficiency scores. Furthermore, exactly the same quantitative relation between word frequency and proficiency is found for monolinguals and three different bilingual populations (Dutch-English, French-English, and German-English). We conclude that the larger frequency effects for second-language processing than for native-language processing can be explained by within-language characteristics and thus need not be the consequence of "being bilingual" (i.e., a qualitative difference). More specifically, we argue that language proficiency increases lexical entrenchment, which leads to a reduced frequency effect, irrespective of bilingualism, language dominance, and language similarity.},

After pointing out problems and omissions, a new model, called the BIA+, is proposed. Structurally, this new model extends the old one by adding phonological and semantic lexical representations to the available orthographic ones, and assigns a different role to the so-called language nodes. Furthermore, it makes a distinction between the effects of non-linguistic context (such as instruction and stimulus list composition) and linguistic context (such as the semantic and syntactic effects of sentence context), based on a distinction between the word identification system itself and a task/decision system that regulates control. At the end of the paper, the generalizability of the BIA+ model to different tasks and modalities is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The fact that mutual intelligibility of Danish-Swedish spoken language is asymmetric can be ex- plained by various linguistic and extra-linguistic factors. The present paper focuses on the role of orthography. Both orthographies are rather conservative, but Danish pronunciation has changed more rapidly during the last century than Swedish pronunciation has. As a consequence of the con- servative spelling, Danes can be expected to have more support from the orthography of their mother tongue than Swedes when listening to the neighbouring language. This hypothesis is tested, first by measuring phonetic distances between the spoken languagesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ adaption and taking into con- sideration the help that the listeners can receive from the orthography when listening to the neigh- bouring language. The distance corrected for orthography turns out to be smaller for the Danes than for the Swedes. This indicates that Danes have more potential help from the orthography than Swedes do. Second, the distance is correlated with the results of a word intelligibility experiment among Danes. The distance corrected for the influence of orthography shows higher correlations with the intelligibility scores than pure phonetic distances. From this, the authors conclude that Danish listeners indeed seem to make use of the additional information that the orthography can provide.},

  Abstract                 = {A lexical decision experiment with Dutch-English bilinguals compared the effect of word frequency on visual word recognition in the first language with that in the second language. Bilinguals showed a considerably larger frequency effect in their second language, even though corpus frequency was matched across languages. Experiment 2 tested monolingual, native speakers of English on the English materials from Experiment 1. This yielded a frequency effect comparable to that of the bilinguals in Dutch (their L1). These results constrain the way in which existing models of word recognition can be extended to unbalanced bilingualism. In particular, the results are compatible with a theory by which the frequency effect originates from implicit learning. They are also compatible with models that attribute frequency effects to serial search in frequency-ordered bins (Murray & Forster, 2004), if these models are extended with the assumption that scanning speed is language dependent, or that bins are not language specific.},

Older adults were also found to be more susceptible to interference from irrelevant information. There was a small negative relation between interference and inhibition, suggesting that participants with the most efficient inhibitory functioning may be the least susceptible to interference. Perceptual speed, an index of processing efficiency, was found to mediate nearly all of the age-related variance in inhibition and interference. Interference, but not inhibition, was found to mediate some of the age-related variance in working memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the $R^2$ statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model $R^2$ statistic for the linear mixed by using only a single model. The proposed $R^2$ statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The $R^2$ statistic arises as a 1-1 function of an appropriate $F$ statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model with a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the $R^2$ statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial $R^2$ statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives a very small $p$-value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure (BP) compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme $p$-value, a very small $R^2$, a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated BP outcomes for the study.},

The studies discussed here view listeners, speakers, and language from a variety of perspectives employing both objective and subjective research paradigms. Interlocutor variables which have been found to influence linguistic perceptions include age, social status, degree of bilingualism, and educational level. Even the linguistic sophistication of the listener may be important.

Studies of error gravity, which treat the perceived seriousness of error types in learners' interlanguage, may now be contrasted with data from several related and unrelated languages. The relative intelligibility of language samples has also been investigated as has the role of comprehension in the information of linguistic judgments.

Research reflecting listeners' personal impressions and reactions shows that non-natives tend to be downgraded in contexts ranging from the classroom to the workplace. This area of experimentation would be enhanced by exploration of the issues through studies in natural sociolinguistic contexts.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years there has been an increase in research on the acquisition of morp hological aspects of a second language (L2). S peci fically, a number of studies have been conducted on the acquisition of grammatical gender in the L2 . The study reported in this paper investigated the adult L2 acquisi tion of grammatical gender in German by first language ( L1 ) speakers of Afrikaans, English and Italian, respectively. The aim of the study was to determine how similarities and differences between the L1 and L2 in terms of grammatical gender affect the acquisition of this aspect of the target L2. Two experimental tasks ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a picture naming task and a sentence completion task ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ were designed to determine to what extent the grammatical gender of nouns is accurately reflected on determiners and adjectives. Throughout, the L1 Italian group out performed the other two grou ps. Since Italian (like German) expresses grammatical gender on determiners and nouns, while neither English nor Afrikaans does, the results indicate that the acquisition of grammatical gender in an L2 is easier for learners whose L1 al so expresses grammat ical gender. Specifically, the results provide evidence for so - called "deep transfer" (transfer of abstract grammatical properties) from the L1 to the L2 in this area of L2 acquisition: since the grammatical gender systems of Italian and German are not con gruent, the Italian speakers' advantage over the other two L1 groups cannot be the result of simple "surface transfer" (transferring knowledge of the grammatical gender of specific nouns in the L1 to the L2) and must be attributed to deep transfer.},

  Abstract                 = {This article shows how language processing is intimately tuned to input frequency. Examples are given of frequency effects in the processing of phonology, phonotactics, reading, spelling, lexis, morphosyntax, formulaic language, language comprehension, grammaticality, sentence production, and syntax. The implications of these effects for the representations and developmental sequence of SLA are discussed. Usage-based theories hold that the acquisition of language is exemplar based. It is the piecemeal learning of many thousands of constructions and the frequency-biased abstraction of regularities within them. Determinants of pattern productivity include the power law of practice, cue competition and constraint satisfaction, connectionist learning, and effects of type and token frequency. The regularities of language emerge from experience as categories and prototypical patterns. The typical route of emergence of constructions is from formula, through low-scope pattern, to construction. Frequency plays a large part in explaining sociolinguistic variation and language change. Learners' sensitivity to frequency in all these domains has implications for theories of implicit and explicit learning and their interactions. The review concludes by considering the history of frequency as an explanatory concept in theoretical and applied linguistics, its 40 years of exile, and its necessary reinstatement as a bridging variable that binds the different schools of language acquisition research.},

  abstract  = {This paper reviews the psycholinguistic factors that affect ease of learning of foreign language (FL) vocabulary and investigates their role in 47 students' learning of German under Repetition, Keyword or "Own" strategy conditions. Native-to-foreign learning is shown to be easier the more the FL words conform to the phonological (.40 < r < .63; p < .01) and orthographic (.28 < r < .45; .05 < p < .01 [sic]) patterns of the native language. However, these relationships are less pronounced (not significant) in foreign-to-native learning. The part of speech (.44 < r < .64; p < .01) and the imageability (.37 < r < .53; .05 < p < .01 [sic]) of the concept are strong determinants of learnability, suggesting an important influence of meaningfulness. Keyword effectiveness, particularly in the case of receptive learning, is influenced by the part of speech and imageability of the keyword. But keywords must also share considerable acoustic similarity with their foreign words to be effective reminders in productive learning (r = .61; p < .01). Otherwise learners must practice these novel phonotactic and orthographic patterns to consolidate them.},

They consider the psycholinguistics of language learning following general cognitive principles of category learning, with schematic constructions emerging from usage. They analyze how learning is driven by the frequency and frequency distribution of exemplars within construction, the salience of their form, the significance of their functional interpretation, the match of their meaning to the construction prototype, and the reliability of their mappings. They explore con - ceptual transfer and the acquisition of second language meaning. They consider the implications of these phenomena for L2 instruction.},

Studies show that individual differences in WM capacity are reflected in performance on antisaccade, Stroop, and dichotic-listening tasks. WM capacity, or executive attention, is most important under conditions in which interference leads to retrieval of response tendencies that conflict with the current task.},

The listeners completed a questionnaire that examines the following variables: intelligibility, grammar, pronunciation, intonation, wrong words, voice, hesitations, distraction and annoyance. It was found that the English and Spanish listeners differed principally in how they rated the linguistic form of the speakers and in the annoyance reported. The Spanish listeners rated the linguistic form much lower than did the English listeners and also reported more annoyance. This indicates that the Spanish listeners were less tolerant toward nonnative speech than were the English listeners. In addition, pronunciation and hesitations were reported by both groups of listeners to be, overall, the features most distracting from the message.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose

Several novel techniques have been developed recently to assess the breadth of a speaker's vocabulary exhibited in a language sample. The specific aim of this study was to increase our understanding of the validity of the scores generated by different lexical diversity (LD) estimation techniques. Four techniques were explored: D, Maas, measure of textual lexical diversity, and moving-average typeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtoken ratio.
Method

Four LD indices were estimated for language samples on 4 discourse tasks (procedures, eventcasts, story retell, and recounts) from 442 adults who are neurologically intact. The resulting data were analyzed using structural equation modeling.
Results

The scores for measure of textual lexical diversity and moving-average typeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtoken ratio were stronger indicators of the LD of the language samples. The results for the other 2 techniques were consistent with the presence of method factors representing construct-irrelevant sources.
Conclusion

These findings offer a deeper understanding of the relative validity of the 4 estimation techniques and should assist clinicians and researchers in the selection of LD measures of language samples that minimize construct-irrelevant sources.},

Some of the inconsistencies in past research may reflect the different methods adopted in assessing speech rate. In particular, repeating word triples may itself involve memory demands, contaminating the correlation between speech rate and memory span in younger children. Analyses using composite speech rate and memory span measures showed that speech rate for word triples shared variance with memory span that was independent of speech rate for single words. Moreover, speech rate for word triples was largely redundant with age in explaining additional variation in memory span once the effects of speech rate for single words were controlled.},

  annote    = {A leading notion is that language skill acquisition declines between childhood and adulthood. While several lines of evidence indicate that declarative ("what'', explicit) memory undergoes maturation, it is commonly assumed that procedural ("how-to'', implicit) memory, in children, is well established. The language superiority of children has been ascribed to the childhood reliance on implicit learning. Here we show that when 8-year-olds, 12-year-olds and young adults were provided with an equivalent multi-session training experience in producing and judging an artificial morphological rule {(AMR),} adults were superior to children of both age groups and the 8-year-olds were the poorest learners in all task parameters including in those that were clearly implicit. The {AMR} consisted of phonological transformations of verbs expressing a semantic distinction: whether the preceding noun was animate or inanimate. No explicit instruction of the {AMR} was provided. The 8-year-olds, unlike most adults and 12-year-olds, failed to explicitly uncover the semantic aspect of the {AMR} and subsequently to generalize it accurately to novel items. However, all participants learned to apply the {AMR} to repeated items and to generalize its phonological patterns to novel items, attaining accurate and fluent production, and exhibiting key characteristics of procedural memory. Nevertheless, adults showed a clear advantage in learning implicit task aspects, and in their long-term retention. Thus, our findings support the notion of age-dependent maturation in the establishment of declarative but also of procedural memory in a complex language task. In line with recent reports of no childhood advantage in non-linguistic skill learning, we propose that under some learning conditions adults can effectively express their language skill acquisition potential. Altogether, the maturational effects in the acquisition of an implicit {AMR} do not support a simple notion of a language skill learning advantage in children.},

ParticipantsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ eye movements were monitored while they silently read limericks in which the end words of the first two lines (e.g., glass/class) would be pronounced differently by Northern and Southern participants. The final word of the limerick (e.g., mass/sparse) then either did or did not rhyme, depending on the readerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs accent. Results showed disruption to eye movement behaviour when the final word did not rhyme, determined by the readerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs accent, suggesting that inner speech resembles our own voice.},

  Abstract                 = {When we read or listen to language, we are faced with the challenge of inferring intended messages from noisy input. This challenge is exacerbated by considerable variability between and within speakers. Focusing on syntactic processing (parsing), we test the hypothesis that language comprehenders rapidly adapt to the syntactic statistics of novel linguistic environments (e.g., speakers or genres). Two self-paced reading experiments investigate changes in readers’ syntactic expectations based on repeated exposure to sentences with temporary syntactic ambiguities (so-called “garden path sentences”). These sentences typically lead to a clear expectation violation signature when the temporary ambiguity is resolved to an a priori less expected structure (e.g., based on the statistics of the lexical context). We find that comprehenders rapidly adapt their syntactic expectations to converge towards the local statistics of novel environments. Specifically, repeated exposure to a priori unexpected structures can reduce, and even completely undo, their processing disadvantage (Experiment 1). The opposite is also observed: a priori expected structures become less expected (even eliciting garden paths) in environments where they are hardly ever observed (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that, when changes in syntactic statistics are to be expected (e.g., when entering a novel environment), comprehenders can rapidly adapt their expectations, thereby overcoming the processing disadvantage that mistaken expectations would otherwise cause. Our findings take a step towards unifying insights from research in expectation-based models of language processing, syntactic priming, and statistical learning.},

When processing speed was regressed out of cognitive measures representing three cognitive domains (crystallized, fluid, and memory) and a general cognitive factor, the trajectory of decline was less severe. Quantitative genetic analyses indicated that environmental variance increases in late adulthood. A substantial portion of the genetic variance for these cognitive abilities was accounted for by genetic variance for speed. With increasing age, genetic variance associated with processing speed becomes a more prominent component of genetic variance for fluid abilities and for the general cognitive factor.},

NE-speaking listeners rated the sentences for overall degree of perceived foreign accent using a 9-point scale. The native Korean (NK) children received significantly higher ratings than the NK adults did, but lower ratings than the NE children. The NK children---even those who had arrived as young children and been enrolled in English-medium schools for an average of 4 years---spoke English with detectable foreign accents. The effects of LOR and the T1--T2 differences were non-significant for both the NK adults and the NK children. The findings were inconsistent with the hypothesis that adult--child differences in L2 speech learning are due to the passing of a critical period. The suggestion is made that the milder foreign accents observed for children than adults are due, in part, to the greater L2 input typically received by immigrant children than adults.},

  abstract  = {This study assessed the relation between non-native subjects' age of learning (AOL) English and the overall degree of perceived foreign accent in their production of English sentences. The 240 native Italian (NI) subjects examined had begun learning English in Canada between the ages of 2 and 23 yr, and had lived in Canada for an average of 32 yr. Native English-speaking listeners used a continuous scale to rate sentences spoken by the NI subjcts and by subjects in a native English comparison group. Estimates of the AOL of onset of foreign accents varied across the ten listeners who rated the sentences, ranging from 3.1 to 11.6 yr (M = 7.4). Foreign accents were evident in sentences spoken by many NI subjects who had begun learning English long before what is traditionally considered to be the end of a critical period. Very few NI subjects who began learning English after the age of 15 yr received ratings that fell within the native English range. Principal component analyses of the NI subjects' responses to a language background questionnaire were followed by multiple-regression analyses. AOL accounted for an average of 59% of variance in the foreign accent ratings. Language use factors accounted for an additional 15% of variance. Gender was also found to influence degree of foreign accent.},

  abstract  = {This study evaluated the critical period hypothesis for second language (L2) acquisition. The participants were 240 native speakers of Korean who differed according to age of arrival (AOA) in the United States (1 to 23 years), but were all experienced in English (mean length of residence = 15 years). The native Korean participants' pronunciation of English was evaluated by having listeners rate their sentences for overall degree of foreign accent; knowledge of English morphosyntax was evaluated using a 144-item grammaticaly judgement test. As AOA increased, the foreign accents grew stronger, and the grammaticality judgment test scores decreased steadily. However, unlike the case for the foreign accent ratings, the effect of AOA on the grammaticality judgment test scores became nonsignificant when variables confounded with AOA were controlled. This suggested that the observed decrease in morphosyntax scores was not the result of passing a maturationally defined critical period. Additional analyses showed that the score for sentences testing knowledge of rule based, generalizable aspects of English morphosyntax varied as a function of how much education the Korean participants had received in the United States. The scores for sentences testing lexically based aspects of English morphosyntax, on the other hand, depended on how much the Koreans used English.},

This study examined this assumption using six samples of preschool children, school-age children, or adults who completed two or more intelligence test batteries. From these samples, composites measuring the broad abilities Crystallized Intelligence, Visual Processing, Fluid Reasoning, and Processing Speed were compared to examine their exchangeability. Results indicate that most CHC broad ability composites produced scores that were not as exchangeable for individuals as may have been assumed by some. Discussion focuses on the influence of score reliability and on the interaction between examinee characteristics and the tasks used to measure the broad abilities.},

By complex, I mean a model that contains terms related by marginality or hierarchy, such as polynomial terms, or main effects and interactions. I call these tables or graphs effect displays. Effect displays are constructed by identifying high-order terms in a generalised linear model. Fitted values under the model are computed for each such term. The lower-order ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂrelativesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ of a high-order term (e.g., main effects marginal to an interaction) are absorbed into the term, allowing the predictors appearing in the high-order term to range over their values. The values of other predictors are fixed at typical values: for example, a covariate could be fixed at its mean or median, a factor at its proportional distribution in the data, or to equal proportions in its several levels. Variations of effect displays are also described, including representation of terms higher-order to any appearing in the model.},

Evidence for publication bias in a set of experiments can be found when the observed number of rejections of the null hypothesis exceeds the expected number of rejections. Application of this test reveals evidence of publication bias in two prominent investigations from experimental psychology that have purported to reveal evidence of extrasensory perception and to indicate severe limitations of the scientific method. The presence of publication bias suggests that those investigations cannot be taken as proper scientific studies of such phenomena, because critical data are not available to the field. Publication bias could partly be avoided if experimental psychologists started using Bayesian data analysis techniques.},

As examples of this principle, we present several techniques for ordering items, levels or variables Ã¢ÂÂoptimallyÃ¢ÂÂ, based on some desired criterion. All of these may be based on eigenvalue or singular-value decompositions.

Along the way, we tell some stories about data display, illustrated by graphsÃ¢ÂÂsome surprisingly bad, and some surprisingly goodÃ¢ÂÂfor showing patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. We hope to raise more questions than we can provide answers for.}

  Abstract                 = {We studied the influence of word frequency and orthographic depth on the interaction of ortho-graphic and phonetic information in word perception. Native speakers of English and Serbo-Croatian were presented with simultaneous printed and spoken verbal stimuli and had to decide whether they were equivalent. Decision reaction time was measured in three experimental conditions: Clear print and clear speech, degraded print and clear speech, and clear print and degraded speech. Within each language, the effects of visual and auditory degradation were measured, relative to the undegraded presentation. Both effects of degradation were much stronger in English than in Serbo-Croatian. Moreover, they were the same for high- and low-frequency words in both languages. These results can be accounted for by a parallel interactive processing model that assumes lateral connections between the orthographic and phonological systems at all of their levels. The structure of these lateral connections is independent of word frequency and is determined by the relationship between spelling and phonology in the language: simple isomorphic connections between graphemes and phonemes in Serbo-Croatian, but more complex, many-to-one, connections in English.},

Furthermore, the strength of the correlation between speed and intelligence does not appear to change with age, and most of the effect of the age-related increase in speed on intelligence appears to be mediated through the effect of speed on working memory.

  Abstract                 = {A number of researchers and scholars have stressed the importance of disconfirmation in the quest for the development of scientific knowledge (e.g., Popper, 1959). Paradoxically, studies examining human reasoning in the laboratory have typically found that people display a confirmation bias in that they are more likely to seek out and attend to data consistent rather than data inconsistent with their initial theory (Wason, 1968). We examine the strategies that scientists and students use to evaluate data that are either consistent or inconsistent with their expectations. First, we present findings from scientists reasoning ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂliveÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in their laboratory meetings. We show that scientists often show an initial reluctance to consider inconsistent data as ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂreal.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ However, this initial reluctance is often overcome with repeated observations of the inconsistent data such that they modify their theories to account for the new data. We further examine these issues in a controlled scien- tific causal thinking simulation specifically developed to examine the reasoning strategies we observed in the natural scientific environment. Like the scientists, we found that participants in our simulation initially displayed a propensity to discount data inconsistent with a theory provided. However, with repeated observations of the inconsistent data, the students, like the scientists, began to see the once anomalous data as ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂrealÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and the initial bias to discount that data was significantly diminished.},

  Abstract                 = {In three experiments, we studied the influence of foreign language knowledge on native language performance in an exclusively native language context. Trilinguals with Dutch as their native and dominant language (L1), English as their second language (L2), and French as their third language (L3) performed a word association task (Experiment 1) or a lexical decision task (Experiments 2 and 3) in L1. The L1 stimulus words were cognates with their translations in English, cognates with their translations in French, or were noncognates. In Experiments 1 and 2 with trilingualswho were highly proficient in English and relatively low in proficiency in French, we observed shorter word association and lexical decision times to the L1 words that were cognates with English than to the noncognates. In these relatively low-proficiency French speakers, response times (RTs) for the L1 words that were cognates with French did not differ from those for the noncognates. In Experiment 3, we tested DutchÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂEnglishÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ French trilinguals with a higher level of fluency in French (i.e., equally fluent in English and in French). We now observed faster responses on the L1 words that were cognates with French than on the noncognates. Lexical decision times to the cognateswith English were also shorter than those to the noncognates. The results indicate that words presented in the dominant language, to naive participants, activate information in the nontarget, and weaker, language in parallel, implying that the multilingualsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ processing system is profoundly nonselective with respect to language. A minimal level of nontarget language fluency seems to be required, however, before any weaker language effects become noticeable in L1 processing.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Given an observed test statistic and its degrees of freedom, one may compute the observed P value with most statistical packages. It is unknown to what extent test statistics and P values are congruent in published medical papers. Methods We checked the congruence of statistical results reported in all the papers of volumes 409ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ412 of Nature (2001) and a random sample of 63 results from volumes 322ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ323 of BMJ (2001). We also tested whether the frequencies of the last digit of a sample of 610 test statistics deviated from a uniform distribution (i.e., equally probable digits). Results 11.6% (21 of 181) and 11.1% (7 of 63) of the statistical results published in Nature and BMJ respectively during 2001 were incongruent, probably mostly due to rounding, transcription, or type-setting errors. At least one such error appeared in 38% and 25% of the papers of Nature and BMJ, respectively. In 12% of the cases, the significance level might change one or more orders of magnitude. The frequencies of the last digit of statistics deviated from the uniform distribution and suggested digit preference in rounding and reporting. Conclusions This incongruence of test statistics and P values is another example that statistical practice is generally poor, even in the most renowned scientific journals, and that quality of papers should be more controlled and valued.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Recursive partitioning is a non-parametric modeling technique, widely used in regression and classification problems. Model-based recursive partitioning is used to identify groups of observations with similar values of parameters of the model of interest. The mob() function in the party package in R implements model-based recursive partitioning method. This method produces predictions based on single tree models. Predictions obtained through single tree models are very sensitive to small changes to the learning sample. We extend the model-based recursive partition method to produce predictions based on multiple tree models constructed on random samples achieved either through bootstrapping (random sampling with replacement) or subsampling (random sampling without replacement) on learning data. Results Here we present an R package called ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmobForestÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ that implements bagging and random forests methodology for model-based recursive partitioning. The mobForest package constructs large number of model-based trees and the predictions are aggregated across these trees resulting in more stable predictions. The package also includes functions for computing predictive accuracy estimates and plots, residuals plot, and variable importance plot. Conclusion The mobForest package implements a random forest type approach for model-based recursive partitioning. The R package along with it source code is available at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mobForest webcite.},

Broadly similar linear functions characterized performance on all measures as a function of age. From 6 years onward, a model consisting of 3 distinct but correlated factors corresponding to the working memory model provided a good fit to the data. The results indicate that the basic modular structure of working memory is present from 6 years of age and possibly earlier, with each component undergoing sizable expansion in functional capacity throughout the early and middle school years to adolescence.},

  Abstract                 = {Geographical variation in Dutch as used in the Low Countries is situated at different levels: at one extreme of the scale there is the level of the base dialects, which has tradi- tionally received a lot of scholarly attention in the form of dialectological research, and on the other extreme there is the level of the standard language, which has predomi- nantly been studied with an eye on the unity and pluricentric nature of the Dutch lan- guage and the consequences of variation for language policy and education. The lan- guage varieties that are stylistically and situationally positioned in between these two levels are also subject to geographical variation: between the level of the standard lan- guage and the level of the base dialects, both the Netherlandic and the Belgian national variety of Dutch include language varieties that have a supra-regional distribution within each nation, and that are situationally and stylistically marked as less formal than the standard language. In this chapter, we will refer to these varieties as the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂcolloquialÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ varieties of Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch. Although their position on the stratifica- tional continuum of Netherlandic Dutch and Belgian Dutch is not entirely the same (as we shall see), we will use a similar format to describe Colloquial Belgian Dutch (by Dirk Geeraerts) and Colloquial Netherlandic Dutch (by Hans Van de Velde). We will first present the linguistic features that are characteristic for the varieties in question. Then we will describe what is known about their distribution and their position within the stratificational continuum. Finally, we will describe the reception of the varieties within the linguistic communities, in terms of attitudes and public debates. Throughout sections 2. and 3. we will point out differences and similarities between the linguistic situation in Belgium and the Netherlands. The main differences are summarized and interpreted in section 4.},

toy for exploring raw data but not much help when it comes to the serious business of

of a hypothetical old-school analytical statistician or social scientist. We hope to elicit

To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary---for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1% significance level to 4.9%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities. The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems---that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting nulll hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between "significant" and "not significant" is not itself statistically significant.},

Across three replicated experiments, we demonstrated that native English speakers are more likely to interpret implausible utterances, such as “the mother gave the candle the daughter,” as similar plausible utterances (“the mother gave the candle to the daughter”) when the speaker has a foreign accent. This result follows from the general model of language interpretation in a noisy channel, under the hypothesis that listeners assume a higher error rate in foreign-accented than in nonaccented speech.},

There is evidence that null hypothesis significance testing as practiced in political science is deeply flawed and widely misunderstood. This is important since most empirical work argues the value of findings through the use of the null hypothesis significance test. In this article I review the history of the null hypothesis significance testing paradigm in the social sciences and discuss major problems, some of which are logical inconsistencies while others are more interpretive in nature. I suggest alternative techniques to convey effectively the importance of data-analytic findings. These recommendations are illustrated with examples using empirical political science publications.},

The data show that the rated skill of a top-level grand master is only slightly lower when he is playing simultaneously against a half-dozen grand-master opponents than under tournament conditions that allow much more time for each move. As simultaneous play allows little time for look-ahead processes, the data indicate that recognition, based on superior chess knowledge, plays a much larger part in high-level skill in this task than does planning by looking ahead.},

To test this proposal, we contrasted the effects of increased word use associated with monolingualism, language dominance, and increased age on picture naming times. In two experiments, younger and older bilinguals and monolinguals named pictures with high- or low-frequency names in English and (if bilingual) also in Spanish. In Experiment 1, slowing related to bilingualism and language dominance was greater for producing low- than high-frequency names. In Experiment 2, slowing related to aging was greater for producing low-frequency names in the dominant language, but when speaking the non-dominant language, increased age attenuated frequency effects and age-related slowing was limited exclusively to high-frequency names. These results challenge competition-based accounts of bilingual disadvantages in language production, and illustrate how between- group processing differences may emerge from cognitive mechanisms general to all speakers.},

  Abstract                 = {With as few as 10-20 sentences of exposure, listeners are able to adapt to speech that is highly distorted compared to that which is encountered in everyday conversation. The current study examines the extent to which adaptation to time-compressed speech can be impeded by disrupting the continuity of the exposure sentences, and whether this differs between young and older adult listeners when they are equated for starting accuracy. In separate sessions conducted one week apart, the degree of adaptation was assessed in four exposure conditions, all of which involved exposure to the same number of time-compressed sentences. A continuous exposure condition involved presentation of the time-compressed sentences without interruption. Two alternation conditions alternated time-compressed speech and uncompressed speech by single sentences or groups of four sentences. A fourth condition presented sentences that were separated by a period of silence but no uncompressed speech. For all conditions, neither young nor older adults' overall level of learning was influenced by disruptions to the exposure sentences. In addition, participants' performance showed reliable improvement across the first and subsequent sessions. These results support robust learning mechanisms in speech perception that remain functional throughout the lifespan.},

  abstract  = {The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

In order to determine how well these linguistic levels can predict intelligibility, we correlated the intelligibility scores with the linguistic distances and we carried out a number of regression analyses. The results show that for this particular set of closely related language varieties phonetic distance is a better predictor of intelligibility than lexical distance.

First, the relative potential for intelligibility of the Low German variety of Bremen and the High German variety of Modern Standard German for speakers of Dutch is tested. Second, the question is raised whether Low German is understood more easily by subjects from the Dutch-German border area than subjects from other areas of the Netherlands. This is investigated empirically. The results show that in general Dutch people are better at understanding Standard German than the Low German variety, but that the subjects from the border area are better at understanding Low German than subjects from other parts of the country. A larger amount of previous experience with the German standard variety than with Low German dialects could explain the first result, while proximity on the sound level could explain the second result.},

English sentences recorded by a native English speaker and a native Spanish speaker, together with hybrid sentences that varied the native language of the speaker of the carrier phrase and the final target word of the sentence were presented to younger and older listeners with normal hearing and older listeners with hearing loss in quiet and noise. Effects of age and hearing loss were observed in both listening environments, but varied with speaker accent. All groups exhibited lower recognition performance for the final target word spoken by the accented speaker compared to that spoken by the native speaker, indicating that alterations in segmental cues due to accent play a prominent role in intelligibility. Effects of the carrier phrase were minimal. The findings indicate that recognition of accented speech, especially in noise, is a particularly challenging communication task for older people.},

  Abstract                 = {Personnel selection research provides much evidence that intelligence (g) is an important predictor of performance in training and on the job, especially in higher level work. This article provides evidence that g has pervasive utility in work settings because it is essentially the ability to deal with cognitive complexity, in particular, with complex information processing. The more complex a work task, the greater the advantages that higher g confers in performing it well. Everyday tasks, like job duties, also differ in their level of complexity. The importance of intelligence therefore differs systematically across different arenas of social life as well as economic endeavor. Data from the National Adult Literacy Survey are used to show how higher levels of cognitive ability systematically improve individualsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ odds of dealing successfully with the ordinary demands of modem life (such as banking, using maps and transportation schedules, reading and understanding forms, interpreting news articles). These and other data are summarized to illustrate how the advantages of higher g, even when they are small, cumulate to affect the overall life chances of individuals at different ranges of the IQ bell curve. The article concludes by suggesting ways to reduce the risks for low-IQ individuals of being left behind by an increasingly complex postindustrial economy.},

Some conclusions dismissed in the media as discredited are actually firmly supported. This statement outlines conclusions regarded as mainstream among researchers on intelligence, in particular, on the nature, origins, and practical consequences of individual and group differences in intelligence. Its aim is to promote more reasoned discussion of the vexing phenomenon that the research has revealed in recent decades. The following conclusions are fully described in the major textbooks, professional journals and encyclopedias in intelligence.},

He measured their capacity and produced the results anticipated in an age when few Caucasians doubted their innate superiority: whites aboves Indians, blacks at the bottom. Morton published all his raw data, and it is shown here that his summary tables are based on a patchwork of apparently unconscious finagling. When his data are properly reinterpreted, all races have approximately equal capacities. Unconscious or dimly perceived finagling is probably endemic in science, since scientists are human beings rooted in cultural contexts, not automatons directed toward external truth.},

This study investigates the interaction between the presence or absence of ex- plicit instruction and the variables complexity and morphology/syntax in the acquisition of four L2 structures. Two groups of 27 university students, differing in the exposure to explicit instruction, followed a computer-controlled self-study course in an artificial language. Re- sults from computer-controlled posttests confirm the general hypothe- sis that explicit instruction facilitates the acquisition of L2 grammar. However, no evidence could be reported for the hypotheses predict- ing a differential effect of explicit instruction depending on the vari- ables complexity and morphology/syntax.},

We asked whether efficient processing of orthographic information could be achieved in the absence of prior language knowledge. To do so, we trained baboons to discriminate English words from nonsense combinations of letters that resembled real words. The results revealed that the baboons were using orthographic information in order to efficiently discriminate words from letter strings that were not words. Our results demonstrate that basic orthographic skills can be acquired in teh absence of preexisting linguistic representations.},

Understanding these abilities in mechanistic terms has the potential to facilitate their enhancement. There is strong evidence that the lateral prefrontal cortex, and possibly other areas, support intelligent behaviour. Variations in intelligence and brain structure are heritable, but are also influenced by factors such as education, family environment and environmental hazards. Cognitive, psychometric, genetic and neuroimaging studies are converging, and the emergence of mechanistic models of intelligence is inevitable. These exciting scientific advances encourage renewed responsiveness to the social and ethical implications of conducting such research.},

Ninety-three children (38.6\%) were reported by parents to speak both Maltese and English at home, 137 (56.9\%) were reported to speak Maltese and 11 (4.7\%) only English at home. The data gained were analyzed for percent consonants and vowels correct, adult phonemes absent, developmental speech error patterns, number of English and Maltese words used, and the percentage of children using translation equivalents. The children who were reported to be only exposed to English at home were not compared statistically with other children because of the small number in that group. The data showed an increase in phonological competence over the age range and differences between children reported to be exposed to one as opposed to two languages at home. Many children, irrespective of reported home language context, used both English and Maltese during assessment. The results were interpreted as showing independent phonological systems that nevertheless interacted; a bilingual language learning context affected word naming language choice.},

  Abstract                 = {This series of three event-related potential experiments explored the issue of whether the underlying mechanism of working memory (WM) supporting language processing is inhibitory or activational in nature. These different cognitive mechanisms have been proposed to explain the more efficient processing of subjects with a high WM span compared to those with a low WM span. Participants with high and low WM span were presented with sentences containing a homonym followed three words later by a nominal disambiguation cue and a final disambiguation using a verb. At the position of the disambiguation cue, inhibitory or activational WM mechanisms predict contrasting results. When activation is the underlying mechanism for efficient processing, the prediction is that high memory span persons activate both meanings of the homonym equally in WM, whereas low memory span persons only have one meaning present. When inhibition is the underlying mechanism, the predictions are the reverse. The ERP data, in particular, the variations of the meaning related N400 component, showed clear evidence for inhibition as the underlying cognitive mechanism in high-span readers. For low-span participants the cueing towards the dominant or the subordinate meaning elicited an equivalently large N400 component suggesting that both meanings are active in WM. In highspan subjects, the dominant disambiguation cue elicited a smaller N400 than the subordinate one, indicating that for these subjects particularly the dominant meaning is active. The experiments showed that inhibitory processes are probably underlying WM used during language comprehension in high-span subjects. Moreover, they demonstrate that these subjects can use their inhibition in a more flexible manner than low-span subjects. The effects that these processing differences have on the efficiency of language parsing are discussed.},

With the help of introspective methods suh as pair think-aloud, the author examines learners' lexical inferencing procedures, i.e. how learners infer the meaning of unknown words that are placed in a comprehensible context. The informants are Danish learners of English, one group with high and one with low proficiency in the target language. Learners' use of interlingual, intralingual and contextual sources are examined. In addition, a taxonomy is developed for describing learner processing with respect to the way in which cues to meaning from context are integrated with linguistic cues. This taxonomy breaks new ground within L2 comprehension theory. Especially the learner-specific procedures add to what is already known about procedural knowledge. Placed at the intersection between a comprehension study and a vocabulary study, both of which take an interest in learners' intake, this book makes important contributions to our knowledge of learners' intake of new words.},

The analyses tested a key prediction of the hypothesis, namely, that the line regressing second-language attainment on age of immigration would be markedly different on either side of the critical-age point. Predictions tested were that there would be a difference in slope, a difference in the mean while controlling for slope, or both. The results showed large linear effects for level of education and for age of immigration, but a negligible amount of additional variance was accounted for when the parameters for difference in slope and difference in means were estimated. Thus, the pattern of decline in second-language acquisition failed to produce the necessary discontinuity that is an essential hallmark of a critical period.},

  Abstract                 = {Children respond more slowly than young adults on a variety of information-processing tasks. The global trend hypothesis posits that processing speed changes as a function of age, and that all component processes change at the same rate. A unique predication of this hypothesis is that the overall response latencies of children of a particular age should be predictable from the latencies of young adults performing the same tasksÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂwithout regard to the specific componential makeup of the task. The current effort tested this predication by examining the performance of 4 age groups (10-, 12-, 15-, and 19-year-olds) on 4 differennt tasks (choice reaction time, letter matching, mental rotation, and abstract matching). An analysis that simultaneously examined performance on all 4 tasks provided strong support for the global trend hypothesis. By plotting each child group's performance on all 4 tasks as a function of the young adult group's performance in the corresponding task conditions, precise linear functions were revealed: 10-year-olds were approximately 1.8 times slower than young adults on all tasks, and 12-year-olds were approximately 1.5 times slower, whereas 15-year-olds appeared to process information as fast as young adults.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decade or so, the concept of multicompetence has attracted
significant research attention in the field of applied linguistics and in particular
in the study of multiple language use and learning. We argue that while
research efforts concerned with multicompetence have been useful in advancing
a more positive view of second language learners, they have been less successful
in transforming understandings of language knowledge. One reason for their
lack of success is the fact that these efforts have been mired in a state of
theoretical confusion arising from a continued reliance on three assumptions.
These assumptions include (1) a view of L1 and L2 language knowledge as
distinct systems; (2) the presumption of a qualitative distinction between
multicompetence and monocompetence; and (3) the assumption of homo-
geneity of language knowledge across speakers and contexts. Our intent here is
to redress these theoretical inadequacies by making a case for a usage-based
view of multicompetence. We do so by drawing on empirical evidence and
theoretical insights from other areas concerned with language and language
development that expose the theoretical flaws in current research efforts on
multicompetence. We then use these new understandings of language to
reconsider findings on the language knowledge of multiple language users and
to offer new directions for research on multicompetence.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study examined how word-initial letters influence lexical access during reading. Eye movements were monitored as participants read sentences containing target words. Three factors were independently manipulated. First, target words had either high or low constraining word-initial letter sequences (e.g., dwarf or clown, respectively). Second, targets were either high or low in frequency of occurrence (e.g., train or stain, respectively). Third, targets were embedded in either biasing or neutral contexts (i.e., targets were high or low in their predictability). This 2 (constraint) ÃÂÃÂ 2 (frequency) ÃÂÃÂ 2 (context) design allowed us to examine the conditions under which a wordÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs initial letter sequence could facilitate processing. Analyses of fixation duration data revealed significant main effects of constraint, frequency, and context. Moreover, in measures taken to reflect ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂearlyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ lexical processing (i.e., first and single fixation duration), there was a significant interaction between constraint and context. The overall pattern of findings suggests lexical access is facilitated by highly constraining word-initial letters. Results are discussed in comparison to recent studies of lexical features involved in word recognition during reading.},

We investigated whether the neural correlates of syntactic processing are modulated by speaker identity. ERPs to gender agreement errors in sentences spoken by a native speaker were compared with the same errors spoken by a non-native speaker. In line with previous research, gender violations in native speech resulted in a P600 effect (larger P600 for violations in comparison with correct sentences), but when the same violations were produced by the non-native speaker with a foreign accent, no P600 effect was observed. Control sentences with semantic violations elicited comparable N400 effects for both the native and the non-native speaker, confirming no general integration problem in foreign-accented speech. The results demonstrate that the P600 is modulated by speaker identity, extending our knowledge about the role of speaker's characteristics on neural correlates of speech processing.},

But what is the role of selfassessment\newline in formal educational settings, where there is less room for\newline self-directed learning? Paradoxically, it is perhaps in these settings that\newline self-assessment is most needed to focus learners' perceptions of progress.\newline Students are often passive in their approach to learning, and may become\newline demotivated if they cannot see any clear progress. Self-assessment produces\newline learners who are more active and focused, and better placed to\newline assess their own progress in terms of communication. This article will\newline discuss these issues, and make some practical suggestions for carrying\newline out self-assessment at both secondary school and university level.},

  Abstract                 = {Given the proliferation of factor analysis applications in the literature, the present article examines the use of factor analysis in current published research across four psycological journals. Notwithstanding ease of analysis due to computers, the appropriate use of factor analysis requires a series of thoughtful researcher judgments. These judgments directly affect results and interpretation. The authors examine across studies (a) the decisions made while conducting exploratory factor analyses (N = 60) and (b) the information reported from the analyses. In doing so, they present a review of the current status of factor analytic practice, including comment on common errors in use and reporting. Recommendations are proffered for future practice as regards analytic decisions and reporting in empirical research.},

  Abstract                 = {This book provides a novel approach to multilingual phenomena as discussed in psycholinguistic research, drawing together (second) language acquisition theory, bilingualism research and dynamic systems theory. Dynamic systems theory, which has been known in other sciences such as physics, mathematics and psychology for some decades, is applied to multilingual systems in order to discuss changees in multilingual proficiency on an individual level and to provide a holistic description of multilingualism. The dynamic interaction between fully developed and developing systems is modelled, and by going beyond the discussion of the contact between two language systems a bridge between the traditionally separated research areas of second language acquisition and bilingualism is created. The model is unfolded step by step, revealing increasing complexities. The various stages are illustrated by numerous graphs which are intended to help the reader understand the concepts introduced. This book should be of interest to researchers in second language acquisition, bilingualism and multilingualism, cognitive linguistics, dynamic systems theory and research methodology, as well as language planners, administrators and other professinoals in the spread of multilingualism. It should also provide a resource text for more advanced students of linguistics, psycholinguistics and applied linguistics.},

In this book Herschensohn examines whether early childhood is a critical period for language acquisition after which invididuals cannot learn a language as native speakers. She argues that a first language is largely susceptible to age constraints, showing major deficits past the age of twelve. Second language acquisition also shows age effects, but with a range of individual differences. The competence of expert adults learners, the unequal achievements of child learners of second languages, and the lack of consistent evidence for a maturational cut-off, all cast doubt on a critical period for second language acquisition.},

The battery also included measures of perceptual speed and speed in working with the PMA answer sheets. There were large age differences for several abilities. Regression analysis showed that (a) these age differences were dramatically attenuated by partialing speed and (b) a substantial proportion of age-related variance is shared in common with speed. The PMA vocabulary test showed an age-related increase in its correlation with answer sheet speed, suggesting an age-related performance bias due to slowing. Substantial speed/intelligence relationships require renewed attention to the role of information-processing speed in age changes on psychometric test performance.},

We review the empirical data from the literature on nonlinguistic interference tasks to assess the validity of this proposed bilingual inhibitory control advantage. Our review of these findings reveals that the bilingual advantage on conflict resolution, which by hypothesis is mediated by inhibitory control, is sporadic at best, and in some cases conspicuously absent. A robust finding from this review is that bilinguals typically outperform on both compatible and incompatible trials, often by similar magnitudes. Together, these findings suggest that bilinguals do enjoy a more widespread cognitive advantage (a bilingual executive processing advantage) that is likely observable on a variety of cognitive assessment tools but that, somewhat ironically, is most often not apparent on traditional assays of nonlinguistic inhibitory control processes.},

The article critically evaluates pertinent research, focusing on the research methods applied, and reaches the conclusion that the competence in native languages apparently does not foster the learning of the lingua franca. As far as school achievement is concerned, competence in the lingua franca seems to be very closely connected with school success. Recently published studies which contain evidence of causal relationships between language competence and school achievement are especially closely examined. Furthermore, an intervention study comparing types of treatments for language learning is discussed and the relevance of broader studies in psychological learning theory to school learning is inquired. Finally the consequences of the findings for school practice and future research are summarized and discussed: About one third of all students in school age are and will be children of migrant background; their presence will be a constant task of the German schools. These students come from more than 150 countries and speak close to 200 family languages; the need for a lingua franca is evident. Until today their school achievement is much worse than that of students without migrant background, the difference being between 2 and 3 school years. There is a strong co-variation between school achievement and competence in the German language which leads to the recommendation to invest into intense training of the language of the school, without recurrence to the family languages. Gifted students with migrant background show good school achievements even if they operate in both languages, their family languages and the lingua franca; treatments in school should become more differentiated. Students without any knowledge of German also have to be differentially treated in the classroom. The important role of the family languages for the individual and for society has to be put into the focus of public discussion. Future research should be directed towards finding causal relationships between teaching and learning outcomes and compare different treatments with German as a second language.},

The focus of the report is on the adulthood decline of Gf. This decline is found to be in the vicinity of between 3 and 7 IQ points per decade over a period between roughly 30 and 60 years of age. The studies were designed to indicate the extent to which this decline could be explained as due to aging defects in processes of sensory detection, immediate apprehension, short-term memory, encoding organization, attentiveness, concentration, hypothesis generation, speediness, carefulness, and persistence. The results suggested that Gf decline is associated mainly with defects in processes of organizing information; becoming alert to new information; ignoring irrelevancies; concentrating, maintaining, and dividing attention; and holding information in working memory. It eems that Gf decline mainly reflects loss of capacity, but decrease in inclination to "get up" for difficult tasks may also be involved, and there are possibilities that the results reflect, in part, cohort differences.},

  Abstract                 = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censonred as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer and mammography experience are re-analyzed.},

These issues concern some of the most fundamental advantages and disadvantages of each basic research design. Problems include improper use of hypothesis tests for covariate balance between the treated and control groups, and the consequences of using randomization, blocking before randomization and matching after assignment of treatment to achieve covariate balance. Applied researchers in a wide range of scientific disciplines seem to fall prey to one or more of these fallacies and as a result make suboptimal design or analysis choices. To clarify these points, we derive a new four-part decomposition of the key estimation errors in making causal inferences. We then show how this decomposition can help scholars from different experimental and observational research traditions to understand better each otherÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs inferential problems and attempted solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Background The random forest (RF) method is a commonly used tool for classification with high dimensional data as well as for ranking candidate predictors based on the so-called random forest variable importance measures (VIMs). However the classification performance of RF is known to be suboptimal in case of strongly unbalanced data, i.e. data where response class sizes differ considerably. Suggestions were made to obtain better classification performance based either on sampling procedures or on cost sensitivity analyses. However to our knowledge the performance of the VIMs has not yet been examined in the case of unbalanced response classes. In this paper we explore the performance of the permutation VIM for unbalanced data settings and introduce an alternative permutation VIM based on the area under the curve (AUC) that is expected to be more robust towards class imbalance. Results We investigated the performance of the standard permutation VIM and of our novel AUC-based permutation VIM for different class imbalance levels using simulated data and real data. The results suggest that the new AUC-based permutation VIM outperforms the standard permutation VIM for unbalanced data settings while both permutation VIMs have equal performance for balanced data settings. Conclusions The standard permutation VIM loses its ability to discriminate between associated predictors and predictors not associated with the response for increasing class imbalance. It is outperformed by our new AUC-based permutation VIM for unbalanced data settings, while the performance of both VIMs is very similar in the case of balanced classes. The new AUC-based VIM is implemented in the R package party for the unbiased RF variant based on conditional inference trees.

Many indices of lexical diversity have been proposed, most of which involve statistical relationships between types and tokens, and which ultimately reflect the rate of word repetition. These indices have generally been validated in accordance with how well they overcome sample-size effects and/or how well they predict language knowledge or behavior, rather than in accordance with how well they actually measure the construct of lexical diversity. In this article, I review developments that have taken place in lexical diversity research, and also describe obstacles that have prevented it from advancing further. I compare these developments with parallel research on biodiversity in the field of ecology, and show what language researchers can learn from ecology regarding the modeling and measurement of diversity as a multidimensional construct of compositional complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {The last decade has witnessed a rapid increase in interest in multilingualism. Whereas a number of scholars in language acquisition research still base their work on the monolingual native speaker norm, others have developed more realistic viewpoints. This article provides an overview of international research on third language learning and teaching, including examples mainly from a European background. It describes sociolinguistic, psycholinguistic and educational aspects of multilingual teaching and emphasizes current research trends in this fairly young area of language teaching. The challenging ways which have been suggested to achieve multilingualism for all necessarily have to address learners, teachers, educators and policy makers. It will be argued that multilingual education can only be successful if language teaching in general is restructured and oriented towards multilingual norms.},

In one study, native speakers of Chinese and Korean, who had arrived inthe U.S. at varying ages, were tested on their knowledge of English grammar using an auditory grammaticality judgment task (Johnson & Newport, 1989). Subjects were tested only after having lived in the U.S. for many years as students or academicians. The present study asks whether the poorer performance exhibited by the older arrivals was due to their difficulty with English grammar or merely due to extragrammatical properties associated with an auditory task. The same subjects who participated in the earlier study were tested a year later using an untimed written version of the same teest. A strong negative correlation was still observed between age of arrival and performance on the written test: r=-.54 for subjects of all ages of arrival; r=-.73 for subjects who arrived to the U.S. before adulthood. Performane was higher on the written version than on the auditory version, but only for the older arrivals. The possibility that earlier formal classroom training boosted the adult arrivals' performane on the written test is discussed.},

  abstract  = {Lenneberg (1967) hypothesized that language could be acquired only within a critical period, extending from early infancy until puberty. In its basic form, the critical period hypothesis need only have consequences for first language acquisition. Nevertheless, it is essential to our understanding of the nature of the hypothesized critical period to determine whether or not it extends as well to second language acquisition. If so, it should be the case that young children are better second language learners than adults and should consequently reach higher levels of final proficiency in the second language. This prediction was tested by comparing the English proficiency attained by 46 native Korean or Chinese speakers who had arrived in the United Status between the ages of 3 and 39, and who had lived in the United States between 3 and 26 years by the time of testing. These subjects were tested on a wide variety of structures of English grammar, using a grammaticality judgment task. Both correlational and t-test analyses demonstrated a clear and strong advantage to age of arrival up to puberty; after puberty, performance was low but highly variable and unrelated to age of arrival. This age effect was shown not to be an inadvertent result of differences in amount of experience with English, motivation, self-consciousness, or American identification. The effect also appeared on every grammatical structure tested, although the structurers varied markedly in the degree to which they were well mastered by later learners. The results support the conclusion that a critical period for language acquisition extends its effects to second language acquisition.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous research suggests that the first and last letters of words are more important than the interior letters during reading. A question that has yet to be fully studied is why this is so. The current study reports four experiments in which participants read sentences containing words with transposed letters occurring at the beginning of the word, near the middle of the word, or at the end of the word. Experiments 1 and 2 also included some sentences where the spaces were removed and replaced with hash marks (#) to equate all letters on their degree of lateral interference from adjacent letter positions. In Experiment 3, equating was done by adding an additional space between all of the letters, so that no letter position received lateral inter- ference from any letter. In Experiment 4, readers read sentences from right to left so that word-initial letters were presented furthest into the parafovea. The results indicate that although the first letter of a word has a privileged role over interior letters regardless of the degree of lateral interference it receives or its location in the parafovea (suggesting that it is intrinsically related to how we process, store, or access lexical informa- tion), the last letter of a word is more important than interior letters only when it receives less lateral inter- ference or when its parafoveal location was close to the fovea (suggesting that it is privileged only due to low-level visual factors). These findings have important implications for current theories and computational models regarding the roles of various letter positions in reading.},

The verbalÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂperceptual model fit significantly better than the other two. We improved it by adding memory and higher-order image rotation factors. The results provide evidence for a four-stratum model with a g factor and three third-stratum factors. The model is consistent with the idea of coordination of function across brain regions and with the known importance of brain laterality in intellectual performance. We argue that this model is theoretically superior to the fluid-crystallized model and highlight the importance of image rotation in human intellectual function.},

We addressed the extent to which this prediction was true using three mental ability batteries administered to a heterogeneous sample of 436 adults. Though the particular tasks used in the batteries reflected varying conceptions of the range of human intellectual performance, the g factors identified by the batteries were completely correlated (correlations were .99, .99, and 1.00). This provides further evidence for the existence of a higher-level g factor and suggests that its measurement is not dependent on the use of specific mental ability tasks.},

This finding provided evidence for the existence of a unitary higher-level general intelligence construct whose measurement is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed. In the current study we constructively replicated this finding utilizing five test batteries. The replication is important because there were substantial differences in both the sample and the batteries administered from those in the original study. The current sample consisted of 500 Dutch seamen of very similar age and somewhat truncated range of ability. The batteries they completed included many tests of perceptual ability and dexterity, and few verbally oriented tests. With the exception of the g correlations involving the Cattell Culture Fair Test, which consists of just four matrix reasoning tasks of very similar methodology, all of the g correlations were at least .95. The lowest g correlation was .77. We discuss the implications of this finding.},

  Abstract                 = {The phonological store construct of the working memory model is critically evaluated. Three experiments test the prediction that the effect of irrelevant sound and the effect of phonological similarity each survive the action of articulatory suppression but only when presentation of to-be-remembered lists is auditory, not visual. No evidence was found to support the interaction predicted among irrelevant speech, modality, and articulatory suppression. Although evidence for an interaction among modality, phonological similarity, and articulatory suppression was found, its presence could be diminished by a suffix, which is an acoustic, not a phonological factor. Coupled with other evidenceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfrom the irrelevant sound effect and errors in natural speechÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthe action attributed to the phonological store seems better described in terms of a combination of auditoryÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂperceptual and output planning mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {The present report is derived from a community survey conducted in 19 villages of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. The population was entirely native-born. The technique involved the use of a free motion-picture performance and supplementary house-to-house visiting. Army Alpha tests were administered under one or the other of these two situations. In these ways data were collected on Army Alpha scores for 1191 subjects between the ages of 10 and 60 years of age. The developmental curve thus secured for the total Alpha test "may be summarized as involving linear growth to about 16 years, with a negative acceleration beyond 16 to a peak between the ages of 18 and 21. A decline follows which is much more gradual than the curve of growth but which by the age of 55 involves a recession to the 14 year level." The curves for sub-tests within the Alpha show important differences among themselves. The subjects from more rural districts made consistently lower scores than those from villages. A slight superiority of females over males was observed. A differential rate of growth (as between bright and dull adolescents) is found, but there seems to be no evidence for a differential duration of growth. The decline of ability beyond age 21 "is not due to errors of sampling" nor to "faulty administration of the Alpha" nor to "failure of motivation, remoteness of schooling, lack of understanding of directions, disproportion in attention to accuracy versus speed, lack of practice in the test functions, failing hearing or failing eyesight." In fact, "the information tests of the Alpha present an unfair advantage to those in the upper age brackets." A bibliography of 33 titles is appended.},

This article aims at reviewing some of the current knowledge surrounding executive functioning and presenting the contrasting views regarding this concept. The neural substrates of the executive system are examined as well as the evolution of executive functioning, from development to decline. There is clear evidence of the vulnerability of executive functions to the effects of age over lifespan. The first executive function to emerge in children is the ability to inhibit overlearned behavior and the last to appear is verbal fluency. Inhibition of irrelevant information seems to decline earlier than set shifting and verbal fluency during senescence. The sequential progression and decline of these functions has been paralleled with the anatomical changes of the frontal lobe and its connections with other brain areas. Generalization of the results presented here are limited due to methodological differences across studies. Analysis of these differences is presented and suggestions for future research are offered.},

  year      = {2015},
  volume    = {16},
  pages     = {405},
  abstract  = {Background
Selection bias occurs when recruiters selectively enrol patients into the trial based on what the next treatment allocation is likely to be. This can occur even if appropriate allocation concealment is used if recruiters can guess the next treatment assignment with some degree of accuracy. This typically occurs in unblinded trials when restricted randomisation is implemented to force the number of patients in each arm or within each centre to be the same. Several methods to reduce the risk of selection bias have been suggested; however, it is unclear how often these techniques are used in practice.

Methods
We performed a review of published trials which were not blinded to assess whether they utilised methods for reducing the risk of selection bias. We assessed the following techniques: (a) blinding of recruiters; (b) use of simple randomisation; (c) avoidance of stratification by site when restricted randomisation is used; (d) avoidance of permuted blocks if stratification by site is used; and (e) incorporation of prognostic covariates into the randomisation procedure when restricted randomisation is used. We included parallel group, individually randomised phase III trials published in four general medical journals (BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine) in 2010.

Results
We identified 152 eligible trials. Most trials (98 %) provided no information on whether recruiters were blind to previous treatment allocations. Only 3 % of trials used simple randomisation; 63 % used some form of restricted randomisation, and 35 % did not state the method of randomisation. Overall, 44 % of trials were stratified by site of recruitment; 27 % were not, and 29 % did not report this information. Most trials that did stratify by site of recruitment used permuted blocks (58 %), and only 15 % reported using random block sizes. Many trials that used restricted randomisation also included prognostic covariates in the randomisation procedure (56 %).

Conclusions
The risk of selection bias could not be ascertained for most trials due to poor reporting. Many trials which did provide details on the randomisation procedure were at risk of selection bias due to a poorly chosen randomisation methods. Techniques to reduce the risk of selection bias should be more widely implemented.},

  Abstract                 = {Listeners are often capable of adjusting to the variability contained in individual talkers’ (speakers’) speech. The vast majority of findings on talker adaptation are concerned with learning the contingency between phonological characteristics and talker identity. In contrast, the present study investigates representations at a more abstract level – the contingency between syntactic attachment style and talker identity. In a ‘visual-world’ experiment, participants were exposed to semi-realistic scenes depicting several objects (e.g., an adult man, a young girl, a motorbike, a carousel, and other objects) accompanied by a spoken sentence with a structurally ambiguous relative clause (e.g., ‘The uncle of the girl who will ride the motorbike/carousel is from France.’ In the context of the scene, ‘motorbike’ suggested the uncle as the agent of the riding, whereas ‘carousel’ suggested the girl as the agent). For half the experimental items, one version of the sentence was read by one talker, who always uttered sentences that resolved, pragmatically, to the high attachment (the uncle as the agent), and the other by another talker, who always uttered sentences resolving to the low attachment (the girl as the agent). For the other half of the experimental items, both versions were read by a third talker who produced both high and low attachments. It was found that, after exposure to these stimuli, and for new sentences not heard previously, participants learnt to anticipate the ‘appropriate’ attachment depending on talker identity (with no attachment preference for the talker who produced both attachment types). The data suggest that listeners can learn the relationship between talker identity and abstract, structural, properties of their speech, and that syntactic attachment decisions in comprehension can reflect sensitivity to talker-specific syntactic style.},

Boxplots have the disadvantage that they are not easy to explain to non-mathematicians, and that some information is not visible. A beanplot is an alternative to the boxplot for visual comparison of univariate data between groups. In a beanplot, the individual observations are shown as small lines in a one-dimensional scatter plot. Next to that, the estimated density of the distributions is visible and the average is shown. It is easy to compare different groups of data in a beanplot and to see if a group contains enough observations to make the group interesting from a statistical point of view. Anomalies in the data, such as bimodal distributions and duplicate measurements, are easily spotted in a beanplot. For groups with two subgroups (e.g., male and female), there is a special asymmetric beanplot. For easy usage, an implementation was made in R.},

Experiment 3 shows that experience with the novel construction affects the processing of a construction already known to the participants and with which the novel construction is temporarily ambiguous. Experiment 4 demonstrates that the influence of a novel construction on the comprehension of familiar constructions is affected by the processing that occurred while the novel construction was learned. These results are discussed in the context of the constraint satisfaction approach to sentence processing and episodic-processing accounts of memory.},

Participants were 24 native English-speaking listeners, half experienced and half inexperienced with L2 speech, who transcribed and rated 90 English utterances spoken by six English and six Mandarin speakers. The utterances varied along two dimensions: real-world expectations (true vs. false utterances) and semantic meaningfulness (meaningful vs. meaningless utterances). Listeners with more experience understood more speech from the L1 and L2 speakers than listeners with less experience but did not rate it differently in comprehensibility and accentedness. All listeners understood and rated the utterances from L2 speakers based on the semantic context available: true–false utterances were understood and rated best, meaningless utterances least. These findings have implications for evaluating learner pronunciation and for training learners in successful L2 communication strategies.},

HARKing is defined as presenting a post hoc hypothesis (i.e., one based on or informed by one's results) in one's research report as if it were, in fact, an a priori hypotheses. Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

The current study investigates contextual memory in a group of healthy young (N = 40) and older (N= 40) adults without dementia. All participants performed a computerized memory task assessing target memory (objects only), contextual memory (positions only) and memory for the combinations of two features (object, space, temporal order), that is, binding of target-context or context-context features. The results showed age-related decline on all task conditions. Furthermore, the performance on conditions requiring the binding of target and context features was affected to a greater extent in older adults compared to younger adults. These findings support the notion that a decline in contextual memory and binding might underlie poorer episodic memory in older participants.},

When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretationsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂpotentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encounteredÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂincluding a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

METHODS Using a case study with accompanying equations, we show that clustered samples are not as statistically efficient as simple random samples.

RESULTS Similarity among subjects within preexisting groups or clusters reduces the variability of responses in a clustered sample, which erodes the power to detect true differences between study arms. This similarity is expressed by the intracluster correlation coefficient, or ÃÂÃÂ (rho), which compares the within-group variance with the between-group variance. Rho is used in equations along with the cluster size and the number of clusters to calculate the effective sample size (ESS) in a clustered design. The ESS should be used to calculate power in the design phase of a clustered study. Appropriate accounting for similarities among subjects in a cluster almost always results in a net loss of power, requiring increased total subject recruitment. Increasing the number of clusters enhances power more efficiently than does increasing the number of subjects within a cluster.

CONCLUSIONS Primary care research frequently uses clustered designs, whether consciously or unconsciously. Researchers must recognize and understand the implications of clusters to avoid costly sample size errors.},

This research tested variation in the replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36 independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect – imagined contact reducing prejudice – showed weak support for replicability. And two effects – flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification – did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect.},

A laboratory experiment using advanced graduate students in the sciences (study 1) and an experimental survey of practicing scientists on opposite sides of a controversial issue (study 2) revealed agreement effects. Research reports that agreed with scientists' prior beliefs were judged to be of higher quality than those that disagreed. In study 1, a prior belief strength x agreement interaction was found, indicating that the agreement effect was larger among scientists who held strong prior beliefs. In both studies, the agreement effect was larger for general, evaluative judgments (e.g., relevance, methodological quality, results clarity) than for more specific, analytical judgments (e.g., adequacy of randomization procedures). A Bayesian analysis indicates that the pattern of agreement effects found in these studies may be normatively defensible, although arguments against implementing a Bayesian approach to scientific judgment are also advanced.},

Although much research has been devoted to figuring out how listeners deal with variability, virtually none (outside of sociolinguistics) has focused on the source of the variation itself. The current experiments explore whether different kinds of variation lead to different cognitive and behavioral adjustments. Specifically, we compare adjustments to the same acoustic consequence when it is due to context-independent variation (resulting from articulatory properties unique to a speaker) versus context-conditioned variation (resulting from common articulatory properties of speakers who share a dialect). The contrasting results for these two cases show that the source of a particular acoustic–phonetic variation affects how that variation is handled by the perceptual system. We also show that changes in perceptual representations do not necessarily lead to changes in production.},

In addition, indicators of general intelligence {(Standard} Progressive Matrices and Digit Span) were assessed. Results were obtained concerning (1) the psychometric quality of the {TKS-I-Scales} and their correlates (age, educational cohort, and general intelligence), (2) the differential diagnosis of balanced versus dominant bi- and multilinguality, and (3) comparative descriptions of the development of active vocabulary and verbal short-term memory in two or three languages in the different age groups and educational cohorts. Age comparisons pointed to similar increases of active vocabulary in the two languages of bilinguals with age (without age differences in verbal short-term memory). While for trilinguals no age differences occur in third-language active vocabulary, verbal short-term memory for the third language increases with age. Partialling out age, semantic development was not significantly correlated with the indicators of general intelligence under study.},

  Abstract                 = {Many perceptual categories exhibit internal structure in which category prototypes play an important role. In the four experiments reported here, the internal structure of phonetic categories was explored in studies involving adults, infants, and monkeys. In Experiment 1, adults rated the category goodness of 64 variants of the vowel lu on a scale from 1 to 7. The results showed that there was a certain location in vowel space where listeners rated the Ii! vowels as best instances, or prototypes. The perceived goodness of/i/ vowels declined systematically as stimuli were further removedfrom the prototypic /1! vowel. Experiment 2 went beyond this initial demonstration and examined the effect of speech prototypes on perception. Either the prototypic or a non- prototypic hi vowel was used as the referent stimulus and adultsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ generalization to other mem- bers of the category was examined. Results showed that the typicality of the speech stimulus strongly affected perception. When the prototype of the category served as the referent vowel, there was significantly greater generalization to other hi vowels, relative to the situation in which the nonprototype served as the referent. The notion of a perceptual magnet was introduced. The prototype of the category functioned like a perceptual magnet for other category members; it as- similated neighboring stimuli, effectively pulling them toward the prototype. In Experiment 3, the ontogenetic origins of the perceptual magnet effect were explored by testing 6-month-old in- fants. The results showed that infantsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ perception of vowels was also strongly affected by speech prototypes. Infants showed significantly greater generalization when the prototype of the vowel category served as the referent; moreover, their responses were highly correlated with those of adults. In Experiment 4, Rhesus monkeys were tested to examine whether or not the prototypeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs magnet effect was unique to humans. The animals did not provide any evidence of speech proto- types; they did not exhibit the magnet effect. It is suggested that the internal organization of phonetic categories around prototypic members is an ontogenetically early, species-specific, aspect of the speech code.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of vocabulary in reading comprehension emphasizes the need to accurately assess an individual's familiarity with words. The present article highlights problems with using occurrence counts in corpora as an index of word familiarity, especially when studying individuals varying in reading experience. We demonstrate via computational simulations and norming studies that corpus-based word frequencies systematically overestimate strenghts of word representations, especially in the low-frequency range and in smaller-size vocabularies. Experience-driven differences in word familiarity prove to be faithfully captured by the subjective frequency ratings collected from responders at different experience levels. When matched on those levels, this lexical measure explains more variance than corpus-based frequencies in eye-movement and lexical decision latencies to English words, attested in populations with varied reading experience and skill. Furthermore, the use of subjective frequencies removes the widely reported (corpus) Frequency x Skill interaction, showing that more skilled readers are equally faster in processing any word than the less skilled readers, not disproportionally faster in processing lower frequency words. This findings challenges the view that the more skilled an individual is in generic mechanisms of word processing, the less reliant he or she will be on the actual lexical characteristics of that word.},

The purpose of the current study was to test the Investment theory, through investigating the effects on the relation between Gf and g of differential learning opportunities for different subsets of a population. A second-order model was fitted with confirmatory factor analysis to a battery of 17 tests hypothesized to measure four broad cognitive abilities The model was estimated for three groups with different learning opportunities (N = 2358 Swedes, N = 620 European immigrants, N = 591 non-European immigrants), as well as for the total group. For this group the gÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂGf relationship was .83, while it was close to unity within each of the three subgroups. These results support the Investment theory.},

Across all experiments, breadth of verbal knowledge was found to be a strong predictor of learning overall and a strong predictor of the increment in learning benefit due to increases in study time. Mnemonic strategy training improved learning but also served to enhance the relationship between knowledge and learning. Memory search speed also predicted learning, but primarily under conditions of high information flow, as a result of short (.5 seconds per pair) study. High-Knowledge subjects and Fast Memory-Search-subjects were also quicker at retrieving the answer, whe nthey knew the answer, but High-Knowledge subjects took longer in retrieving an answer under conditions of uncertainty. Results are discussed in terms of a general model of associative learning in which encoding is viewed as a process of generating links by constructing elaborations of the terms studied.},

An experiment has been carried out which shows that the linguistic information conveyed by a vowel sound does not depend onthe absolute values of its formant frequencies, but on the relationship between the formant frequencies for that vowel and the formant frequencies of the other vowels pronounced by that speaker. Six version of the sentence Please say what this word is were synthesized on a Parametric Artificial Talking device. Four test words of the form b-(vowel)-t were also synthesized. It is shown that the identification of the test word depends on the formant structure of the introductory sentence. Some psychoogical implications of this experiment are discussed, and hypotheses are put forward concerning the ways in which all three kinds of information are conveyed by vowels.},

These experiments dealt with such questions as, Do students have the ability to meaningfully evaluate their own performance? Does the type of instrument used effect that ability? Can students be satisfactorily placed by self-assessment results alone? The conclusion is that at least under the conditions described, self-assessment must be considered a very valuable tool as a placement instrument.},

  Abstract                 = {In two experiments, the relative contribution of consonants and vowels in word identification in English was assessed in a paradigm in which the onset of one or two letters was delayed at the beginning of a fixation in reading. In both experiments, delaying the onset of a consonant for 30 ms at the beginning of an eye fixation increased the gaze duration on the target word more than delaying the onset of a vowel did. With 60-ms delays, delaying letter onset was equally disruptive for consonants and vowels. The results suggest that there is a temporal distinction between the contribution of consonants and vowels during the reading of English: consonants play a more important role than vowels at the early stage of word identification.},

  Abstract                 = {A simulated randomized clinical trial in coronary artery disease was conducted to illustrate the need for clinical judgment and modern statistical methods in assessing therapeutic claims in studies of complex diseases. Clinicians should be aware of problems that occur when a patient sample is subdivided and treatment effects are assessed within multiple prognostic categories. In this example, 1073 consecutive, medically treated coronary artery disease patients from the Duke University data bank were randomized into two groups. The groups were reasonably comparable and, as expected, there was no overall difference in survival.In a subgroup of 397 patients characterized by three-vessel disease and an abnormal left vetricular contraction, however, survival of group 1 patients was significantly different from that of group 2 patients. Multivariable adjustment procedures revealed that the difference resulted from the combined effect of small imbalances in the distribution of several prognostic factors. Another subgroup was identified in which a significant survival difference was not explained by multivariable methods. These are not unlikely examples in trials of a complex disease. Clinicians must exercise careful judgment in attributing such results to an efficacious therapy, as they may be due to chance or to inadequate baseline comparability of the groups.},

Furthermore, the validity of LexTALE was compared with that of self-ratings of proficiency, a measure frequently used by L2 researchers. The results showed the following in both speaker groups: (1) LexTALE was a good predictor of English vocabulary knowledge; 2) it also correlated substantially with a measure of general English proficiency; and 3) LexTALE was generally superior to self-ratings in its predictions. LexTALE, but not self-ratings, also correlated highly with previous experimental data on two word recognition paradigms. The test can be carried out on or downloaded from www.lextale.com.},

  Abstract                 = {Many studies have reported that word recognition in a second language (L2) is affected by the native language (L1). However, little is known about the role of the specific language combination of the bilinguals. To investigate this issue, the authors administered a word identification task (progressive demasking) on 1,025 monosyllabic English (L2) words to native speakers of French, German, and Dutch. A regression approach was adopted, including a large number of within- and between-language variables as predictors. A substantial overlap of reaction time patterns was found across the groups of bilinguals, showing that word recognition results obtained for one group of bilinguals generalize to bilinguals with different mother tongues. Moreover, among the set of significant predictors, only one between-language variable was present (cognate status); all others reflected characteristics of the target language. Thus, although influences across languages exist, word recognition in L2 by proficient bilinguals is primarily determined by within-language factors, whereas cross-language effects appear to be limited. An additional comparison of the bilingual data with a native control group showed that there are subtle but significant differences between L1 and L2 processing.},

  Abstract                 = {In four experiments, we investigated how cross-linguistic overlap in semantics, orthography, and phonology affects bilingual word recognition in different variants of the lexical decision task. Dutch-English bilinguals performed a language-specific or a generalized lexical decision task including words that are spelled and/or pronounced the same in English and in Dutch and that matched one-language control words from both languages. In Experiments 1 and 3, ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfalse friendsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ with different meanings in the two languages (e.g.,spot) were presented, whereas in Experiments 2 and 4 cognates with the same meanings across languages (e.g.,film) were presented. The language-specific Experiments 1 and 2 replicated and qualified an earlier study (Dijkstra, Grainger, & Van Heuven, 1999). In the generalized Experiment 3, participants reacted equally quickly on Dutch-English homographs and Dutch control words, indicating that their response was based primarily on the fastest available orthographic code (i.e., Dutch). In Experiment 4, cognates were recognized faster than English and Dutch controls, suggesting coactivation of the cognatesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ semantics. The nonword results indicate that the bilingual rejection procedure can, to some extent, be language specific. All results are discussed within the BIA+ (bilingual interactive activation) model for bilingual word recognition.},

The results of Analysis 1 revealed that a linear function with a slope of approximately 1.5 described the relationship between the lexical decision latencies of older (65-75 years) and younger (19-29) adults. The results of Analysis 2, based on response latencies from 6 lexical tasks other than lexical decision, revealed a virtually identical linear relationship. In Analysis 3, it was found that performance on nonlexical tasks spanning the same range of task difficulty was described by a significantly steeper regression line with a slope of approximately 2.0. These findings suggest that although general cognitive slowing is observed in both domains, the degree of slowing is significantly greater in the nonlexical domain than in the lexical domain. In addition, these analyses demonstrate how the meta-analytic approach may be used to determine the limits to the external validity of experimental findings.},

Age trends of all 5 abilities were well described by a negative linear function. The speed-mediated effect of age fully explained the relationship between age and both the common and the specific variance of the other 4 abilities.

Specifically, we investigated whether high- and low-capacity individuals differed in their susceptibility to interference on the Stroop task and whether high-capacity individuals employed a strategy for minimizing Stroop interference. In Experiment 1, we found that high-capacity participants showed substantial interference when conflict trials were infrequent, but almost no interference when conflict trials were frequent. In contrast, low-capacity participants showed substantial interference irrespective of the proportion of conflict trials. In Experiment 2, we found that high-capacity participants experienced substantial negative priming, slow responses when the to-be-named color was the irrelevant word on the previous trial. We discuss these results and their implications for high-capacity individuals' ability to reduce Stroop interference in light of both inhibitory and noninhibitory accounts of negative priming.},

  abstract  = {While almost all observers agree that young children, older children, and adults differ both in initial rate of acquisition and in the level of ultimate attainment typically achieved, they continue to disagree over whether the observed pattern are a function of nurture or nature. Is it simply that older starters do not do as well because they are less motivated, receive poorer quality input, spend less time on task, or (paradoxically) are hindered by superior cognitive development, or is it that they cannot? In particular, well-respected scholars differ on the existence, scope, and timing of putative maturational constraints on the human capacity for learning second (including foreign) languages. Some recent research on age differences is considered, in particular, studies purporting to provide evidene against claims of maturational constraints on (Second) Language Acquisition (SLA) and/or putative critical periods for L2 phonology, morphology and syntax. It is argued that, in each case, one or more of nine limitations or design flaws means that the findings are, in fact, unproblematic for at least some of those claims.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examined the roles of learning method, word frequency, and cognate status in the learning of 80 Italian words by 56 adult Dutch learners previously unfamiliar with Italian. We contrasted 2 learning methods: word learning, where the Italian word was presented with its translation in Dutch, and picture learning, where it was presented with a picture depicting its referent. At test, either pictures or the Dutch words constituted the cues for recall of the Italian words. Recall was tested twice: once after 3 learning trials per stimulus, and a second time after an additional 3 learning trials. Two measures served as dependent variables: retrieval times and recall scores. The results show (a) that word learning resulted in better performance than picture learning; (b) that performance was better when the study and test conditions were congruent than when they were incongruent; and (c) that cognates and high-frequency words were easier to learn than noncognates and low-frequency words. Particularly noteworthy is that after 6 learning trials performance had not yet become independent of learning method. We discuss the implications of these results for bilingual memory representation and for sequencing curricula for foreign-language learning.},

The bilinguals, who were about twenty years old, were divided into two groups (early bilinguals and late bilinguals) according to whether they became actively bilingual before or after the age of ten years. Early bilinguals and monolinguals demonstrated similar levels of English proficiency, and both groups were more proficient in English than late bilinguals. In contrast, early bilinguals produced the smallest response time cost for incongruent trials (flanker effect) with no difference between monolingual and late bilinguals. Moreover, across the whole sample of bilinguals, onset age of active bilingualism was negatively correlated with English proficiency and positively correlated with the flanker effect. These results suggest a gradient in which more experience in being actively bilingual is associated with greater advantages in cognitive control and higher language proficiency.},

Specifically, we asked whether the priming of a word (e.g. sea, ÃÂÃÂ®lm, basic) by a rhyming non-word would depend on the non-word's phonemic-feature similarity to the word. The question was asked within a maskÃÂÃÂ±primeÃÂÃÂ±targetÃÂÃÂ±mask sequence with both brief (57 ms in Experiments 1 and 2) and long (486 ms in Experiment 1) prime durations. Non-word primes that differed from their targets by a single phonemic feature (initial voicing as in ZEA, VILM, PASIC) led to faster target lexical decisions than non-word primes that differed by more than a single phonemic feature (e.g. VEA, JILM, SASIC).

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

Our study examines on which basis speakers of German recognize Germanic cognates and which factors other than similarity play a role in this process. According to our data the recognition of words depends primarily on a spontaneous sense of similarity, which in most cases is a good predictor for word recognition; however, it turned out that other types of associations are involved, too, which poses a challenge for didactic approaches to intercomprehension.},

Im Rahmen eines Konzeptes, das Zweitsprachen und TertiÃÂÃÂ¤rsprachen als besondere Elemente fÃÂÃÂ¼r Mehrsprachigkeit ansieht, soll mit dieser Reihe ein Forum speziell fÃÂÃÂ¼r Theoretisches, Empirisches und Methodisches zu TertiÃÂÃÂ¤rsprachen geschaffen werden. Es soll dazu beitragen, die bisherige Bilingualismusforschung in Bezug auf die Unterschiede einer ersten Fremdsprache von einer zweiten oder weiter Fremdsprachen zu prÃÂÃÂ¤zisieren. Gerade romanische Sprachen werden in Deutschland zumeist als zweite, dritte, vierte etc. Fremdsprache gelernt, also als TertiÃÂÃÂ¤rsprachen. Dieser TertiÃÂÃÂ¤rsprachenerwerb ist durch das Anwenden von Lernerstrategien gekennzeichnet, die man sich im Laufe des Erwerbs der ersten Fremdsprache angeeignet hat. Die vorliegende Studie analysiert die Strategien unterschiedlichster Lerner bei der Erschliessung fremdsprachlichen Wortschatzes. Die Ergebnisse geben Aufschluss darÃÂÃÂ¼ber, auf welche Weise mehrere (verwandte) Sprachen zugleich mental verarbeitet werden.

The consequences of dichotomization for measurement and statistical analyses are illustrated and discussed. The use of dichotomization in practice is described, and justifications that are offered for such usage are examined.

In this article, the authors present an alternative account motivated by a connectionist approach to language comprehension. In their view, processing capacity emerges from network architecture and experience and is not a primitive that can vary independently. Individual differences in comprehension do not stem from variations in a separate working memory capacity; instead they emerge from an interaction of biological factors and language experience. This alternative is argued to provide a superior account of comprehension results previously attributed to a separate working memory capacity.},

Anyone who has had to name the color of the ink in which an incompatible color word is printed (e.g., to say "blue" in response to the word yellow printed in blue ink) and who has experienced the unavoidable, stumbling interference that occurs will always remember the experience. The Stroop effect, however, is more than a cognitive curiosity; it continues to play a key role in the understanding of attention.},

The present study illustrates this claim in a test of sentence interpretation by German-, Italian-, and English-speaking adults. Subjects were presented with simple transitive sentences in which contrasts of (1) word order, (2) agreement, (3) animacy, and (4) stress were systematically varied. For each sentence, subjects were asked to state which of the two nouns was the actor. The results indicated that Americans relied overwhelming on word order, using a first-noun strategy in NVN and a second-noun strategy in VNN and NNV sentences. Germans relied on both agreement and animacy. Italians showed extreme reliance on agree- ment cues. In both German and Italian, stress played a role in terms of complex interactions with word order and agreement. The findings were interpreted in terms of the "competition model" of Bates and MacWhinney (in H. Winitz (Ed.), Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Conference on Native and Foreign Language Acquisition. New York: New York Academy of Sciences, 1982) in which cue validity is considered to be the primary determinant of cue strength.

Each of 108 subjects between 20 and 78 years of age performed a word/nonword discrimination (lexical decision) task in which the target was preceded by a single-word prime. Several aspects of the data were consistent with a generalized slowing model: There was a positive correlation between age and mean reaction time, the absolute magnitude of age differences increased a s a function of task complexity, and the statistical control of a relatively task-independent index of processing speed attenuated the age-related variance in mean reaction time. The degree of age-related slowing was more pronounced for visually degraded targets (10 msec per year) than for intact targets (4 msec per year). Other aspects of lexical decision performance, however, suggested that some components of word identification, especially those involved in semantic activation, are relatively exempt from age-related slowing.},

For example, although publication is a critical element in determining the contribution and impact of scientific findings, little research attention has been devoted to the variables operative in journal review policies. In the present study, 75 journal reviewers were asked to referee manuscripts which described identical experimental procedures but which reported positive, negative, mixed, or no results. In addition to showing poor interrater agreement, reviewers were strongly biased against manuscripts which reported results contrary to their theoretical perspective.

The subjects were 40 third-grade children (20 bilingual and 20 monolingual) recruited from independent schools in the USA. The two groups of participants were compared on their performance on a standardized test of receptive vocabulary and an experimental measure of word meanings, the WordÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂContext Test. Results revealed that on average, the bilingual children had smaller vocabularies in English. The bilinguals deduced the meaning from context of more words than the monolingual children, although there were no differences between groups on the rate of reaching the target meanings for words on which they were successful, and on the quality of their definitions. Moreover, bilingual children approached the task differently and they showed greater flexibility when analyzing word meanings from verbal context, thus indicating that bilinguals may be more efficient vocabulary learners than monolinguals.},

  Abstract                 = {Age has often been considered a major, if not the primary, factor determining success in learning a second or foreign language. Children are generally considered capable of acquiring a new language rapidly and with little effort, whereas adults are believed to be doomed to failure. Although older learners are indeed less likely than young children to master an L2, a close examination of studies relating age to language acquisition reveals that age differences reflect differences in the situation of learning rather than in capacity to learn. They do not demonstrate any constraint on the possibility that adults can become highly proficient, even nativelike, speakers of L2s. Researchers, in other words, have often committed the same blunders as members of the general public: misinterpretation of the facts relating to speed of acquisition, misattribution of age differences in language abilities to neurobiological factors, and, most notably, a misemphasis on poor adult learners and an underemphasis on adults who master L2s to nativelike levels. By clarifying these misconceptions, we hope this article will lead to a better understanding of L2 learning and, in turn, better approaches to L2 teaching.},

Van Ooijen (1996) introduced a new task, the word reconstruction task, for exploring this question. Participants are presented a spoken non-word that can be altered to a word by changing either one vowel or one consonant. Van Ooijen found that participants made more errors in the consonant-change condition than in the vowel-change condition and were generally faster in the vowel-change condition, an effect she called vowel mutability. The present study replicates Van Ooijen's (1996) procedure with monolingual Spanish listeners and bilingual Spanish-English listeners in an attempt to detect any differences in processing between monolingual and bilingual listeners of languages that are structurally different. The results showed a clear vowel mutability effect in both groups of listeners, suggesting that neither the size of the vowel repertoire nor the monolingual versus bilingual mode of processing are the cause of vowel mutability.},

Participants were tested on their ability to induce the grammatical forms and to generalize the forms to novel utterances. Individual differences in final abilities in vocabulary and grammar correlated between 0.44 and 0.76, depending on the measure. Despite these strong associations, the results demonstrated significant independent effects of PSTM and WM on L2 vocabulary learning and on L2 grammar learning, some of which were mediated by vocabulary and some of which were direct effects.},

The present study investigated 73 German university students who read a short text in an unknown Germanic language (Danish, Dutch, Icelandic, Norwegian or Swedish) and then answered specific questions on content and structure. Results showed significantly higher success rates on all measures for Dutch, with isolated significant differences between the other languages and higher success in decoding lexical, in comparison to structural, information. No individual learner variables were found to be correlated with success. These data have implications for planning courses in Germanic intercomprehension, especially regarding time allotted the various languages.},

  Abstract                 = {The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the approach to lexical diversity assessment known as the measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD). The index for this approach is calculated as the mean length of word strings that maintain a criterion level of lexical variation. To validate the MTLD approach, we compared it against the performances of the primary competing indices in the field, which include vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule's K, and an HD-D index derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. The comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. The results of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest three major findings. First, MTLD performs well with respect to all four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found to vary as a function of text length. Second, HD-D is a viable alternative to the vocd-D standard. And third, three of the indices--MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas--appear to capture unique lexical information. We conclude by advising researchers to consider using MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index, noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation.},

The model is called the TRACE model because the network of units forms a dynamic processing structure called ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthe Trace,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ which serves at once as the perceptual processing mechanism and as the systemÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs working memory. The model is instantiated in two simulation programs. TRACE 1. described in detail elsewhere. deals with short segments of real speech, and suggests a mechanism for coping with the fact that the cues to the identity of phonemes vary as a function of context. TRACE II, the focus of this article, simulates a large number of empirical findings on the perception of phonemes and words and on the interactions of phoneme and word perception. At the phoneme level, TRACE II simulates the influence of lexical information on the identification of phonemes and accounts for the fact that lexical effects are found under certain conditions but not others. The model also shows how knowledge of phonological constraints can be embodied in particular lexical items but can still be used to influence processing of novel, nonword utterances. The model also exhibits categorical perception and the ability to trade cues off against each other in phoneme identification. At the word level, the model captures the major positive feature of Marslen-WilsonÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs COHORT model of speech perception, in that it shows immediate sensitivity to information favoring one word or set of words over others. At the same time, it overcomes a difftculty with the COHORT model: it can recover from underspecitication or mispronunciation of a wordÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs beginning. TRACE II also uses lexical information to segment a stream of speech into a sequence of words and to find word beginnings and endings, and it simulates a number of recent findings related to these points. The TRACE model has some limitations, but we believe it is a step toward a psychologically and computationally adequate model of the process of speech perception.},

Although the two models differ in a number of ways, the strong correspondence between the two models has resulted in the increased use of a broadumbrella termfor a synthesis of the two models (CattellÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂHornÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂCarroll theory of cognitive abilitiesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂCHC theory). The purpose of this editorial is three-fold. First, I will describe the CHC framework and recommend that intelligence researchers begin using the CHC taxonomy as a common nomenclature for describing research findings and a theoretical framework from which to test hypotheses regarding various aspects of human cognitive abilities. Second, I argue that the emergence of the CHC framework should not be viewed as the capstone to the psychometric era of factor analytic research. Rather, I recommend the CHC framework serve as the stepping stone to reinvigorate the investigation of the structure of human intelligence. Finally, the Woodcock-MuÃÂÃÂ±oz Foundation Human Cognitive Abilities (HCA) project, which is an evolving, free, on-line electronic archive of the majority of datasets analyzed in Carroll's (1993) seminal treatise on factor analysis of human cognitive abilities, is introduced and described. Intelligence scholars are urged to access the Carroll HCA datasets to test and evaluate structural models of human intelligence with contemporary methods (confirmatory factor analysis). In addition, suggestions are offered for linking the analysis of contemporary data sets with the seminal work of Carroll. The emergence of a consensus CHC taxonomy and access to the original datasets analyzed by Carroll provides an unprecedented opportunity to extend and refine our understanding of human intelligence.},

Sharkey (1992) found that a word in a sentence did not give facilitation to an immediately following, highly associated test item. In this article it is shown that such facilitation can be obtained. Other theories have proposed that syntactic processes supply antecedents for implicit anaphors. In using a test item that was an associate of the antecedent of the anaphor, the authors were unable to replicate previous findings of facilitation at but not before the site of the anaphor. Across 9 experiments, obtaining facilitation depended on the choice of control condition. This dependency raises questions about previous on-line lexical decision results that have been used to support the immediacy of syntactic processing.},

  Abstract                 = {A perceptual learning experiment provides evidence that the mental lexicon cannot consist solely of detailed acoustic traces of recognition episodes. In a training lexical decision phase, listeners heard an ambiguous [f-s] fricative sound, replacing either [f] or [s] in words. In a test phase, listeners then made lexical decisions to visual targets following auditory primes. Critical materials were minimal pairs that could be a word with either [f] or [s] (cf. English knife-nice), none of which had been heard in training. Listeners interpreted the minimal pair words differently in the second phase according to the training received in the first phase. Therefore lexically mediated retuning of phoneme perception not only influences categorical decisions about fricatives (Norris, McQueen & Cutler, 2003), but also benefits recognition of words outside the training set. The observed generalization across words suggests that this retuning occurs prelexically. Therefore, lexical processing involves sublexical phonological abstraction, not only accumlation of acoustic episodes.},

Some theories explain this in terms of competition between multiply activated lexical hypotheses; others invoke sensitivity to prosodic structure. We describe a connectionist model, SHORTLIST, in which recognition by activation and competition is successful with a realistically sized lexicon. Three experiments are then reported in which listeners detected real words embedded in nonsense strings, some of which were themselves the onsets of longer words. Effects both of competition between words and of prosodic structure were observed, suggesting that activation and competition alone are not sufficient to explain word recognition in continuous speech. However, the results can be accounted for by a version of SHORTLIST that is sensitive to prosodic structure.},

  Volume                   = {59},

  Abstract                 = {Background and Objective

Epidemiologic studies commonly estimate associations between predictors (risk factors) and outcome. Most software automatically exclude subjects with missing values. This commonly causes bias because missing values seldom occur completely at random (MCAR) but rather selectively based on other (observed) variables, missing at random (MAR). Multiple imputation (MI) of missing predictor values using all observed information including outcome is advocated to deal with selective missing values. This seems a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Methods

We tested this hypothesis using data from a study on diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. We selected five predictors of pulmonary embolism without missing values. Their regression coefficients and standard errors (SEs) estimated from the original sample were considered as ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtrueÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ values. We assigned missing values to these predictorsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂboth MCAR and MARÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂand repeated this 1,000 times using simulations. Per simulation we multiple imputed the missing values without and with the outcome, and compared the regression coefficients and SEs to the truth.
Results

Regression coefficients based on MI including outcome were close to the truth. MI without outcome yielded very biasedÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂunderestimatedÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂcoefficients. SEs and coverage of the 90% confidence intervals were not different between MI with and without outcome. Results were the same for MCAR and MAR.
Conclusion

For all types of missing values, imputation of missing predictor values using the outcome is preferred over imputation without outcome and is no self-fulfilling prophecy.},

This advantage may be a consequence of the fact that bilinguals have more practice controlling attention due to an ongoing need to manage two languages. However, existing evidence is limited because possible differences in ethnicity and socioeconomic status have not been properly controlled. To address this issue, we administered the Simon task to bilingual and monolingual children of identical ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Bilingual and monolingual children performed identically, whereas children from higher SES families were advantaged relative to children from lower SES families. Controlling differences in SES and ethnicity may attenuate the bilingual advantage in cognitive control.},

It attempts to explore this question by focusing on four discussion points in the current debate: (i) the wide use of native-speaker behaviour as the key L2 attainment yardstick; (ii) the degree of compatibility of prevailing views regarding the notion of a critical period for L2 acquisition; (iii) the relative narrowness of much research in this area, where age of L2 onset is often regarded as the crucial if not the only critical variable; and (iv) insights relative to maturational constraints on language acquisition offered by recent brain research. The article concludes that a loosening of the association between ultimate L2 attainment research and Critical Period Hypothesis (CPH) issues would shed more light on L2 attainment in terms both of the comprehensiveness and of the acuity of the insights which would result.},

At the same time, additional research provides evidence that bilingual Spanish dominant students use fewer cognitive strategies than children who communicate through the use of only one communication system (Padrón, 1985).

The bilingual Spanish dominant students in this experimental study were taught to use metacognitive reading strategies while reading in Spanish. Primary findings indicated that, following training in metacognitive Spanish reading strategies, Spanish dominant bilingual children improved in the area of reading performance on the La Prueba Spanish reading test and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills English reading test. Post interview results of the Burke Reading Interview, translated into Spanish, showed increases in the frequency of Spanish reading strategies following metacognitive intervention. A directionality was also found in the area of transferal of metacognitive strategies across languages (from Spanish to English).},

  Abstract                 = {One of the chief goals of most second language learners is to be understood in their second language by a wide range of interlocutors in a variety of contexts. Although a nonnative accent can sometimes interfere with this goal, prior to the publication of this study, second language researchers and teachers alike were aware that an accent itself does not necessarily act as a communicative barrier. Nonetheless, there had been very little empirical investigation of how the presence of a nonnative accent affects intelligibility, and the notions of “heavy accent” and “low intelligibility” had often been confounded. Some of the key findings of the study—that even heavily accented speech is sometimes perfectly intelligible and that prosodic errors appear to be a more potent force in the loss of intelligibility than phonetic errors—added support to some common, but weakly substantiated beliefs. The study also provided a framework for a program of research to evaluate the ways in which such factors as intelligibility and comprehensibility are related to a number of other dimensions. The authors have extended and replicated the work begun in this study to include learners representing other L1 backgrounds (Cantonese, Japanese, Polish, Spanish) and different levels of learner proficiency, as well as other discourse types (Derwing & Munro, 1997; Munro & Derwing, 1995). Further support for the notion that accent itself should be regarded as a secondary concern was obtained in a study of processing difficulty (Munro & Derwing, 1995), which revealed that nonnative utterances tend to require more time to process than native-produced speech, but failed to indicate a relationship between strength of accent and processing time.

The approach to L2 speech evaluation used in this study has also proved useful in investigations of the benefits of different methods of teaching of pronunciation to ESL learners. In particular, it is now clear that learner assessments are best carried out with attention to the multidimensional nature of L2 speech, rather than with a simple focus on global accentedness. It has been shown, for instance, that some pedagogical methods may be effective in improving intelligibility while others may have an effect only on accentedness (Derwing, Munro, & Wiebe,1998).},

However, recent empirical work (Wason and Johnson-Laird, 1972) suggests the existence of a confirmation bias, at least on abstract problems. Using a more realistic, computer controlled environment modeled after a real research setting, subjects in this study first formulated hypotheses about laws governing events occurring in the environment. They then chose between pairs of environments in which they could: (1) make observations which would probably confirm these hypotheses, or (2) test alternative hypotheses. Strong evidence for a confirmation bias involving failure to choose environments allowing tests of alternative hypotheses was found. However, when subjects did obtain explicit falsifying information, they used this information to reject incorrect hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a name-based categorization task, Nazzi found in 2005 that French-learning 20-month-olds can make use of one-feature consonantal contrasts between new labels but fail to do so with one-feature vocalic contrasts. This asymmetry was interpreted as developmental evidence for the proposal that consonants play a more important role than vowels at the lexical level. In the current study using the same task, we first show that by 30 months French-learning infants can make use of one-feature vocalic contrasts (e.g., /pize/ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ/pyze/). Second, we show that in a situation where infants must neglect either a consonantal one-feature change or a vocalic one-feature change (e.g., match a /pide/ with either a /tide/ or a /pyde/), both French- and English-learning 30-month-olds choose to neglect the vocalic change rather than the consonantal change. We argue that these results suggest that by 30 months of age, infants still give less weight to vocalic information than to consonantal information in a lexically related task even though they are able to process fine vocalic information.},

  Abstract                 = {In the fall of 1994, the publication of Herrnstein and Murray's book The Bell Curve sparked a new round of debate about the meaning of intelligence test scores and the nature of intelligence. The debate was characterized by strong assertions as well as by strong feelings. Unfortunately, those assertions often revealed serious misunderstandings of what has (and has not) been demonstrated by scientific research in this field. Although a great deal is now known, the issues remain complex and in many cases still unresolved. Another unfortunate aspect of the debate was that many participants made little effort to distinguish scientific issues from political ones. Research findings were often assessed not so much on their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications. In such a climate, individuals who wish to make their own judgments find it hard to know what to believe. Reviewing the intelligence debate at its meeting of November 1994, the Board of Scientific Affairs (BSA) of the American Psychological Association (APA) concluded that there was urgent need for an authoritative report on these issues--one that all sides could use as a basis for discussion. Acting by unanimous vote, BSA established a Task Force charged with preparing such a report. Ulric Neisser, Professor of Psychology at Emory University and a member of BSA, was appointed Chair. The APA Board on the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest, which was consulted extensively during this process, nominated one member of the Task Force," the Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment nominated another," a third was nominated by the Council of Representatives. Other members were chosen by an extended consultative process, with the aim of representing a broad range of expertise and opinion. The Task Force met twice, in January and March of 1995. Between and after these meetings, drafts of the various sections were circulated, revised, and revised yet again. Disputes were resolved by discussion. As a result, the report presented here has the unanimous support of the entire Task Force.},

While the heritability of psychometric intelligence is well understood, we know only a little about genetic and environmental influences on ECT performance, particularly about genetic and environmental contributions to ECTÃÂÃÂ± intelligence relation. These questions were studied by employing two widely used ECTs (Sternberg's memory scanning and Posner's letter-matching task) as well as two psychometric intelligence tests (Advanced Progressive Matrices and Leistungs-PrÃÂÃÂ¼f System) in a large sample of 169 monozygotic (MZ) and 131 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. As expected, RTs correlated negatively with psychometric intelligence. Moreover, heritability estimates were substantial for both psychometric intelligence and RTs in ECTs. Finally, multivariate genetic analyses suggested that most of the phenotypic correlation between mental speed and intelligence is due to genetic factors.},

In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05) but the other is not (P > 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling.},

  Abstract                 = {We review new findings and new theoretical developments in the field of intelligence. New findings include the following: (a) Heritability of IQ varies significantly by social class. (b) Almost no genetic polymorphisms have been discovered that are consistently associated with variation in IQ in the normal range. (c) Much has been learned about the biological underpinnings of intelligence. (d) ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂCrystallizedÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfluidÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ IQ are quite different aspects of intelligence at both the behavioral and biological levels. (e) The importance of the environment for IQ is established by the 12-point to 18-point increase in IQ when children are adopted from working-class to middle-class homes. (f) Even when improvements in IQ produced by the most effective early childhood interventions fail to persist, there can be very marked effects on academic achievement and life outcomes. (g) In most developed countries studied, gains on IQ tests have continued, and they are beginning in the developing world. (h) Sex differences in aspects of intelligence are due partly to identifiable biological factors and partly to socialization factors. (i) The IQ gap between Blacks and Whites has been reduced by 0.33 SD in recent years. We report theorizing concerning (a) the relationship between working memory and intelligence, (b) the appar- ent contradiction between strong heritability effects on IQ and strong secular effects on IQ, (c) whether a general intelligence factor could arise from initially largely inde- pendent cognitive skills, (d) the relation between self-regulation and cognitive skills, and (e) the effects of stress on intelligence.},

Specifically, we examine the effects of the number of rank categories (C) for rank-order variables on the product moment correlation (r) between stretched scales and an equal distance scoring system. The stretched scales are drawn from three types of distributions: (1) the uniform distribution (i.e., the one used by Labovitz), (2) the normal distribution, and (3) a skewed distribution (log-normal distribution). We find that the average correlation between the equal distance scoring system and the stretched scale is quite high for both the uniform and normal distribution, and that it increases with C only when C is greater than four or five. Thus, contrary to suggestions in the literature, it is not a monotonic function of C. More importantly, for the skewed distribution, it is a monotonically decreasing function of C and is substantially smaller than it's based on uniform and normal distributions. The implications of these findings for the use of Pearson's r with rank-order values are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This book reconsiders a question that many language teachers and educational researchers have discussed: how much influence a learner's native language can have in making the acquisition of a new language easy or difficult. Transfer has long been a controversial issue, but many recent studies support the view that cross-linguistic influences can have an important impact on second language acquisition. Odlin analyzes and interprets research, showing many ways in which similarities and differences between languages can influence the acquisition of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. He provides a detailed look at work on other areas important for the study of transfer, including discourse, individual variation, and sociolinguistic factors. Language teachers, applied linguists, and educational researchers will find this volume highly accessible and extremely valuable to their work.},

  Abstract                 = {Three studies compared bilinguals to monolinguals on 15 indicators of executive processing (EP). Most of the indicators compare a neu- tral or congruent baseline to a condition that should require EP. For each of the measures there was no main effect of group and a highly significant main effect of condition. The critical marker for a bilin- gual advantage, the Group ÃÂÃÂ Condition interaction, was significant for only one indicator, but in a pattern indicative of a bilingual disadvantage. Tasks include antisaccade (Study 1), Simon (Studies 1ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ3), flanker (Study 3), and color-shape switching (Studies 1ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ3). The two groups performed identically on the RavenÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Advanced Matrices test (Study 3). Analyses on the combined data selecting subsets that are precisely matched on parentÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs educational level or that include only highly fluent bilinguals reveal exactly the same pattern of results. A problem reconfirmed by the present study is that effects assumed to be indicators of a specific executive process in one task (e.g., inhibitory control in the flanker task) frequently do not predict individual differences in that same indicator on a related task (e.g., inhibitory control in the Simon task). The absence of consistent cross-task correlations undermines the interpretation that these are valid indicators of domain-general abilities. In a final discussion the underlying rationale for hypothesizing bilingual advantages in executive processing based on the special linguistic demands placed on bilinguals is interrogated.},

We report results from two experiments showing evidence that participants better discriminate a segmental duration contrast in a novel language if they had some previous exposure to a language that uses duration contrastively. Crucially, the perceptual advantage occurs even when the novel language employs the contrast in entirely different conditions: in novel segmental contexts and for novel segments, including a change from application to vowels to application to consonants. We take these results to suggest that language learners use their knowledge of previously learned language to make inferences about the ways in which language are likely to vary, which in turn increases their perceptual sensitivity when languages do in fact vary in the predicted ways.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a framework of second and additional language (L2/Ln) acquisition motivated by recent work on socio-indexical knowledge in first language (L1) processing. The distribution of linguistic categories covaries with socio-indexical variables (e.g., talker identity, gender, dialects). We summarize evidence that implicit probabilistic knowledge of this covariance is critical to L1 processing, and propose that L2/Ln learning uses the same type of socio-indexical information to probabilistically infer latent hierarchical structure over previously learned and new languages. This structure guides the acquisition of new languages based on their inferred place within that hierarchy and is itself continuously revised based on new input from any language. This proposal unifies L1 processing and L2/Ln acquisition as probabilistic inference under uncertainty over socio-indexical structure. It also offers a new perspective on crosslinguistic influences during L2/Ln learning, accommodating gradient and continued transfer (both negative and positive) from previously learned to novel languages, and vice versa.},

The results indicate that while reading comprehension is impacted by level of receptive vocabulary knowledge, the ability to select and implement word-appropriate lexical inferencing strategies can compensate for low receptive vocabularies in relation to the demands of the text. The ability to,make this selection, however, implies not only sensitivity to word structure, but also the ability to implement morphological analysis in conjunction with contextual guessing, where appropriate. These findings suggest that the development of English as a second language reading proficiency may be accelerated by acquisition of the meanings of the most productive affixes of English in conjunction with instruction in the principles of morphological analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Social scientists are increasingly encouraged to locate, access and analyse data from data archives worldwide. Although the vast majority of data archives which service the research community deal exclusively with the storage and provision of quantitative data, facilities also exist for the deposit and reuese of qualitative data. While archiving is generally understood as relatively unproblematic by the quantitative research community, there has been a mixed reaction to data archiving among qualitative social science researchers. Much of this concern stems from the assumption that qualitative data are similar to, and may therefore be treated in the same way as, quantitative data. However, the joint construction of qualitative data between researcher and respondent has important implications for the ownership and control of research material. This article suggests that the archiving of qualitative data raises a distinct set of issues surrounding confidentiality, respondent and researcher anonymity and respondent consent. It examines some of the practical, legal and ethical issues which may affect the archiving of qualitative research data, and in doing so it reflects on the viability of using qualitative data for theoretical and substantive secondary analysis. It also highlights the importance of drawing on the experience of other disciplines, such as oral history, with a longer tradition of archiving in order to develop appropriate disciplinary guidance for social scientists engaged in qualitative research.},

The study investigates: (1) the extent to which self-assessment is a valid and reliable indicator of tested proficiency in French immersion programs; (2) how benchmarks influence correlations of self-assessment with tested proficiency; (3) whether self-assessment research can inform or support current theories of second language learning and assessment. The results indicate that: (1) selfassessments of language proficiency correlate only weakly with objective measures of language proficiency; (2) self-assessment measures on specific tasks are more highly correlated with tested proficiency than are global selfassessment measures; (3)},

We studied a group of {Italian-English} bilinguals who acquired L2 after the age of 10 years thigh proficiency, late acquisition bilinguals) and a group of {Spanish-Catalan} bilinguals who acquired L2 before the age of 4 years thigh proficiency, early acquisition bilinguals), The differing cortical responses we had observed when low proficiency volunteers listened to stories in L1 and L2 were not found in either of the high proficiency groups in this Study, Several brain areas, similar to those observed for L1 in low proficiency bilinguals, were activated by L2, These findings suggest that, at least for pairs of L1 and L2 languages that are fairly close, attained proficiency is more important than age of acquisition as a determinant of the cortical representation of L2.},

We begin this paper with a literature review on the two basic ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂneighborhoodÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ effects (neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency). This review shows that the number of higher frequency neighbors is inhibitory in reading. We also examine the influence of orthographic structure in form- and repetition-priming effects, which again suggests that orthographic neighbors seem to play an inhibitory role in the selection process. Finally, we discuss the empirical evidence in the context of current models of visual word recognition and reading.},

Many well meaning researchers, eager for methodological rigour, comply without fully grasping what is at stake. Recently, adjustments for multiple tests (or Bonferroni adjustments) have found their way into introductory texts on medical statistics, which has increased their apparent legitimacy. This paper advances the view, widely held by epidemiologists, that Bonferroni adjustments are, at best, unnecessary and, at worst, deleterious to sound statistical inference.},

The study revealed that the majority of intermediate and advanced learners of German assessed their German reading competence one level below their overall German competence as measured by the placement test. Correlations between self-assessment and test results were moderate. Furthermore, our data reveal that learnersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ confidence when answering reading comprehension questions increases on the higher levels of German competence and is correlated with the correctness of their answers. However, with regard to some very intricate reading items participants often fail to realise that a comprehension problem exists.},

This paper discusses the relationship between students' reading competence in their other foreign languages (mostly English, French or Italian, or Spanish) and their results on our German-reading test. Our results show that especially the less advanced readers of German benefit from their English-reading competence. With increasing competence in German, the influence of English decreases. Furthermore, correlations between the German-reading test and students' overall foreign-language-reading competence hint at possible advantages of being multilingual. Thus, we will aim at exploring to what extent receptive competences in other foreign languages serve to compensate for weaknesses in the knowledge of the target language, in the hope of complementing existing research on reading in an L3.},

relevance to these new contexts of use. This review highlights current research from
diverse areas of applied linguistics that have addressed aspects of intelligibility in
both experimental and real-world settings. Current findings suggest that the
processes by which understanding is achieved in English as a lingua franca (ELF)
interaction are qualitatively different from those observed in native speaker (NS)ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ
based interaction, and that this has implications for a number of research and
practice areas. Following a definition of terms, the chapter surveys current research

Principal Findings We examined the citation history of 85 cancer microarray clinical trial publications with respect to the availability of their data. The 48% of trials with publicly available microarray data received 85% of the aggregate citations. Publicly available data was significantly (p = 0.006) associated with a 69% increase in citations, independently of journal impact factor, date of publication, and author country of origin using linear regression. Significance This correlation between publicly available data and increased literature impact may further motivate investigators to share their detailed research data.},

However, despite arriving to the U.S. at a relatively young age, and having sufficient command of English to attend a competitive university, the bilinguals had lower receptive and expressive English vocabularies than their monolingual peers. Age of arrival was moderately correlated with English vocabulary scores. The younger the bilingual students were when they arrived to the U.S., the better their English vocabulary. Both groups had similar performance on phonetic fluency. However, the bilingual group performed significantly lower in semantic fluency. This pattern of performance in verbal fluency is consistent with that found in previous studies.},

Training with a frequent exemplar and training with a more diverse exemplar set led to equivalent learning. However, providing explicit rules with correctness feedback led to better generalization and retention than did correctness feedback alone or feature focusing without explicit rule information. This suggests that, at least for some grammar tasks, explicit information about formÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfunction mappings improves learning. Moreover, the advantage of rule instruction was robust to testing and training under time pressure. Thus, rule instruction may be helpful even when speeded performance is required, supporting the prediction that practice leads to proceduralization of declarative grammatical knowledge.},

Participants were 53 Israeli high school students who emigrated from the former Soviet Union, and spoke Russian as an L1 and Hebrew as an L2. L2 vocabulary knowledge and decoding accuracy predicted L2 reading comprehension, which in turn was strongly related to lexical inferencing abilities in the L2. In addition, decoding accuracy predicted additional variance in lexical inferencing, beyond the role of reading comprehension. These findings support the idea that beginning L2 readers with more precise and efficient lexical representations demonstrate better lexical inferencing abilities, most likely due to the increased automatization of word reading, which frees up resources for higher level processing. These results suggest that lexical inferencing from text in the L2 might be limited not only by vocabulary knowledge and higher order comprehension processes, but also by basic decoding skills.},

This article explores the implications of ISMDs for estimating interrater reliability. The authors first provide a mock example that illustrates potential problems that ISMDs create for common reliability estimators (e.g., Pearson correlations, intraclass correlations). Next, the authors propose an alternative reliability estimator--G(q,k)--that resolves problems with traditional estimators and is equally appropriate for crossed, nested, and ill-structured designs. By using Monte Carlo simulation, the authors evaluate the accuracy of traditional reliability estimators compared with that of G(q,k) for ratings arising from ISMDs. Regardless of condition, G(q,k) yielded estimates as precise or more precise than those of traditional estimators. The advantage of G(q,k) over the traditional estimators became more pronounced with increases in the (a) overlap between the sets of raters that rated each ratee and (b) ratio of rater main effect variance to true score variance. Discussion focuses on implications of this work for organizational research and practice.},

In particular, it shows that current `single factorÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ models for cognitive ageing, and for general intellectual abilities neglect the complexity of even apparently very simple tasks; that older individuals can be impressively good at acquiring new skills; that the performance of older people on novel tasks is different from that of young adults not only in quantitative terms, because they are slower and less accurate, but also qualitatively, in ways similar to individuals who have suffered damage to the frontal lobes of their brains. We celebrate AlanÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ s prescience in being the first to clearly raise these issues, and to discuss elegant but sadly neglected experimental paradigms and techniques of analysis that allow them to be explored.},

In particular, it observes how learners make use of their background languages when faced with a language they know little to nothing about. The participants, native French speakers with English as a common L2 (other L2s varied) exposed to Polish (L3) for the very first time, were tested on initial exposure and then at various intervals up to 8 hours. The input provided to our learners from the moment of first exposure was recorded and transcribed. This methodology allowed us to analyze learners' use of prior linguistic knowledge (L1 and other L2s) when performing tasks in a language with low proficiency. Tasks included translating written and spoken sentences. Despite a limited number of participants in each language group, results indicate tendencies. They not only suggest an important role for both typology and psychotypology at this level of proficiency, but they also reveal that even minimal knowledge of a background language can be the source of cross-linguistic influence of various types.},

Ignoring correlated measurement error not only affected the acceptability of a model based on goodness-of-fit measures, but also affected the parameter estimation. Ignoring within-construct correlated error does not affect the estimates of the structural parameter but overestimates the associated measurement parameters. It is shown analytically and empirically that ignoring positive between-construct correlated error overestimates the structural parameter linking the two constructs. The effects become more pronounced with decreasing reliability in measurement.},

  Abstract                 = {Temporal dynamics of attention during postural perturbations in young and older adults were investigated. Nineteen young and older subjects performed simple reaction time tasks during translational platform perturbations. Auditory or visual stimuli were presented randomly at delays from the onset of the platform perturbation. Reaction time was slowed before and during the platform movement, particularly in older subjects. Reaction times to stimuli presented at a 250-millisecond delay or later were not influenced by perturbation. The reaction times to the auditory stimuli were influenced more by perturbation than were those to visual targets. The postural response was unaltered by the presence of the reaction time task, but it differed between groups. Attention is engaged in response to a perturbation during the preperturbation time and during the initiation of the postural response in young and older adults. Sensory selection occurs in young and older adults, but to a greater degree in older subjects.},

The quintessence of lingua receptiva is discussed in terms of pragmatic, psycholinguistic and language psychology approaches to multilingualism. Moreover, the occurrence of this mode is documented across various language families throughout time and in various discursive intercultures which it creates. Furthermore, three central characteristics are discussed, namely ideological barriers resulting in asymmetry, ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinference-makingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mechanisms and the function of idiomatic expressions. Finally, lingua receptiva is compared to other multilingual modes, especially with English as lingua franca.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies of transfer have dealt with its effects on either speaking or writing, whereas the effects on reading and listening have been neglected. In this paper, transfer is examined in relation to the different demands that the four language modalities make on the learner. The main differences between L2 comprehension and L2 production concern the roles played by context and by potential knowledge. Transfer in comprehension is overt transfer, in which some cross-linguistic similarity has been perceived between L2 input and existing or potential L1-based knowledge, and which has an overwhelmingly facilitative effect on learning. In production, on the other hand, there is also covert transfer, in which L1-based forms and procedures are used in the absence of appropriate L2-based forms or procedures. This means that the relative strength of the positive versus the negative effects of transfer are much more difficult to assess in production. However, because comprehension normally precedes production, transfer in comprehension is at least as important as is transfer in production.},

Training took place under conditions with no focus on form (implicit and incidental condi- tions) and with focus on form (enhanced and instructed conditions). The presentation of instances during training was manipulated as a test of predictions made by LoganÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs (1988, 1990, 1992) memory- based instance theory of automaticity. Results measured in reaction times show similar slopes for automaticity on trained examples in each condition but significant differences in the extent of learning, with the focus on form conditions outperforming the no focus on form conditions in transfer of learned knowledge to accurate judgments of new ungrammatical sentences. Implications are drawn from the re- sults regarding the acquisition of rule-based versus memory-based knowledge from exposure to stimuli in each training condition and the influence of this knowledge on decision-making about grammaticality during the transfer task.},

  annote    = {Bilingualism or multilingualism is not the aberration supposed by those speaking a 'big language' but rather the default situation for the majority of speech communities in the world today. Based on this perspective, the psycholinguistic foundations of second language acquisition are explored in the first part of this paper and it is argued that bilingual education in a monolingual society should start as early as preschool. It is suggested that acquiring a second language does not represent any additional burden for young children but that it rather fosters cognitive development and flexibility. In the second part of the paper I take a look at different preschool programmes in Germany with a special focus on enrichment programmes. Two German bilingual preschools {(L1} {German/L2} English and L1 {German/L2} French) are introduced and their structures discussed in some detail. It is argued that even in a situation where the use of the L2 is limited to preschool contexts, the children develop considerable linguistic skills in the new language. These skills are evaluated and discussed with regard to bilingual education in primary school. In conclusion, it is suggested that a second language can be mastered in both comprehension and production by the time it is traditionally introduced, i.e. at age 10, so that a further language {(L3)} can be introduced in advance.},

The specific cognitive abilities of interest were: working memory, processing speed, and spatial ability. General cognitive ability was measured with the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices and the Mill Hill Vocabulary Scales. When controlling for working memory, processing speed, and spatial ability, in a sample of 71 young adults (29 males), measures of general cognitive ability continued to add to the prediction of academic achievement, but none of the specific cognitive abilities accounted for additional variance in academic achievement after controlling for general cognitive ability. However, processing speed and spatial ability continued to account for a significant amount of additional variance when predicting scores for the mathematical portion of the SAT while holding general cognitive ability constant.},

  Abstract                 = {Self-assessment has been used widely in language testing research, but has produced\newline variable results. In many quarters self-assessment is considered a viable\newline alternative to formal second language assessment for placement and criterionreferenced\newline interpretations, although variation in self-assessment validity coefficients\newline suggests potential difficulty in accurate interpretation. This article first\newline summarizes the research literature with the use of a formal meta-analysis conducted\newline on 60 correlations reported in the second language testing literature. These are\newline the basis for estimates of median effect sizes for second language speaking, listening,\newline reading and writing tests. The second phase of the study is an empirical analysis\newline of the validity of a self-assessment instrument. 236 'just-instructed' English as\newline a foreign language learners completed self-assessments of functional English skills\newline derived from},

Notwithstanding, there is controversy as to what this observation means for the Critical Period Hypothesis' (CPH) application to adult second language acquisition (SLA). As most versions of the CPH applied to SLA claim that differences result from maturational effects on in-born linguistic mechanisms, the CPH has many implications that are amendable to empirical investigation. To date, there is no shortage of literature claiming that the CPH applies or does not apply to normal adult SLA. Herein, I provide an epistemological discussion on the conceptual usefulness of the CPH in SLA (cf. Singleton 2005) coupled with a review of Long's (2005) evaluation of much available relevant research. Crucially, I review studies that Long did not consider and conclude differently that there is no critical/sensitive period for L2 syntactic and semantic acquisition.},

Unfortunately, reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists shuld not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrog that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

If neuroscience experiments often lead to large, complex and multidimensional data, most analyses rely on t-tests and ANOVAs on means. These analyses are of limited sensitivity to differences among distributions and perform poorly for data that do not conform to the tests{\textquoteright} assumptions. Results also rarely show the underlying distributions by using inappropriate graphical representations such as bar graphs. Here we present powerful alternative tools that provide both detailed illustrations of effects and robust inferences. These tools quantify how distributions differ and can be applied at different levels of analysis. We describe this graphical approach to group comparisons, and provide implementations in R and Matlab.},

  Abstract                 = {High temporal resolution event-related brain potential and electroencephalographic coherence studies of the neural substrate of short-term storage in working memory indicate that the sustained coactivation of both prefrontal cortex and the posterior cortical systems that participate in the initial perception and comprehension of the retained information are involved in its storage. These studies further show that short-term storage mechanisms involve an increase in neural synchrony between prefrontal cortex and posterior cortex and the enhanced activation of long-term memory representations of material held in short-term memory. This activation begins during the encoding/comprehension phase and evidently is prolonged into the retention phase by attentional drive from prefrontal cortex control systems. A parsimonious interpretation of these findings is that the long-term memory systems associated with the posterior cortical processors provide the necessary representational basis for working memory, with the property of short-term memory decay being primarily due to the posterior system. In this view, there is no reason to posit specialized neural systems whose functions are limited to those of short-term storage buffers. Prefrontal cortex provides the attentional pointer system for maintaining activation in the appropriate posterior processing systems. Short-term memory capacity and phenomena such as displacement of information in short-term memory are determined by limitations on the number of pointers that can be sustained by the prefrontal control systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A body of work has accumulated to show that the cognitive process of binding information from different mnemonic and sensory sources as well as in different linguistic modalities can be fractionated from general executive functions in working memory both functionally and neurally. This process has been defined in terms of the episodic buffer (Baddeley in Trends Cogn Sci 4(11):417ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ423, 2000). This paper considers behavioural, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data that elucidate the role of the episodic buffer in language processing. We argue that the episodic buffer seems to be truly multimodal in function and that while formation of unitary multidimensional representations in the episodic buffer seems to engage posterior neural networks, maintenance of such representations is supported by frontal networks. Although, the episodic buffer is not necessarily supported by executive processes and seems to be supported by different neural networks, it may operate in tandem with the central executive during effortful language processing. There is also evidence to suggest engagement of the phonological loop during buffer processing. The hippocampus seems to play a role in formation but not maintenance of representations in the episodic buffer of working memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Two studies were conducted to determine the relative importance of processing speed and knowledge as predictors of performance in simple verbal tasks within samples of young and old adults. Eight different criterion tasks were investigated, and performance on each was found to be significantly related both to speed of processing and to quantity of word knowledge. It was also discovered that although young adults were faster than old adults and that old adults were equal or superior to young adults in relevant knowledge, the same regression equations could be used to predict criterion performance in both groups. These results therefore suggest that any age-related compensation that exists in these tasks is rather weak, in the sense that speed and knowledge appear to have the same importance in young and old adults, and only the average levels of the predictors differ as a function of age.},

This implication was tested in a study in which interference measures from three variants of a Stroop task served as the measures of inhibition. Although the age-related variance in measures of working memory was substantially reduced after control of the interference measures, the degree of attenuation was at least as large when speed measures from other tasks were controlled. Furthermore, additional analyses revealed that speed measures from tasks requiring oral, written, and keypress responses shared large proportions of their age-related variance. It was suggested that age-related influences on specific processes, such as inhbition, cannot be accurately assessed unless the contributions of more general age-related influences are taken into account.},

Relevant information was obtained from three sources: re-analyses of data from previous studies, a study in which 791 adults performed storage-plus-processing working memory tasks, and a study in which 236 adults performed a variety of working memory, updating, and cognitive control tasks. The results suggest that fluid intelligence represents a broad individual difference dimension contributing to diverse types of controlled or effortful processing. The analyses also revealed that very few of the age-related effects on the target variables were statistically independent of effects on established cognitive abilities, which suggests most of the age-related influences on a wide variety of cognitive control variables overlap with age-related influences on cognitive abilities such as fluid intelligence, episodic memory, and perceptual speed.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. Methods and Findings: We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journalÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoSÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. Conclusions: We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.},

  Abstract                 = {In a number of perception studies, the Levenshtein algorithm has been employed successfully to calculate phonetic distance between language varieties. Recently, these phonetic distances have been used to predict word recognition in Scandinavian varieties among adults (Beijering et al. 2008), Gooskens & Heeringa 2006), KÃÂÃÂ¼rsch- ner et al. 2008). If recognition scores are analysed per word, correlation coefficients with phonetic distances were reported to be significant, but lower than if they are averaged over several varieties. Since there is evi- dence that adult listeners benefit from their native writing skills when decoding spoken language (Perre & Ziegler 2008, Perre et al. 2009), we hypothesised that the Levenshtein algorithm is more suitable to predict word recognition in illiterate subjects. This hypothesis was tested with 21 Swedish-speaking pre-schoolers that were auditorily presented with a set of Danish stimuli and instructed to choose the corresponding picture on a touch screen in a multiple choice picture-pointing task. Correlation coefficients between word recognition scores and phonetic distances confirmed our hypothesis that the Levenshtein algorithm predicts word recognition more accurately for naÃÂÃÂ¯ve listeners (r = -.62, p < .001) than for literate adults with certain L2 know- ledge of other languages. This finding confirms that word recognition of closely related languages is heavily influenced by extra-linguistic factors such as literacy. These factors need to be considered by educationalist developing language materials aimed at teaching closely related languages, both in Scandinavia and elsewhere.},

  Abstract                 = {Danish and Swedish are closely related languages that are generally mutually intelligible. Previous research has shown, however, that Danes comprehend more spoken Swedish than vice versa. It has been suggested that this asymmetry is caused by extra-linguistic factors such as literacy, contact with, and attitudes held towards the test language. However, also linguistic factors, such as suprasegmental features or differences in speech rate, could cause or increase an asymmetry. The aim of the experiment reported in this article was to exclude three extra-linguistic factors (attitude, contact and literacy) in order to determine their role in mutual intelligibility. Participants were 19 Danish- and 26 Swedish-speaking illiterate preschoolers. Their task was to match 50 cognate nouns to corresponding pictures in a multiple-choice task. Results revealed that word-recognition scores in Danish children (63 percent) did not differ significantly from the Swedish scores (65 percent). That means that, in contrast to adult Danes, Danish children did not perform better on the word-recognition task than their Swedish peers. This finding suggests that extra-linguistic factors play an important role in intelligibility of a closely related language, and, as extra-linguistic factors develop, the intelligibility asymmetry develops.},

  Abstract                 = {Danish and Swedish are mutually intelligible to a certain extent, but it has been shown that adult Danes confronted with spoken Swedish recognise more items than adult Swedes who are confronted with spoken Danish. However, this asymmetry was not confirmed for illiterate Danish and Swedish preschoolers, which suggests that the factors that were controlled for in the study with preschoolers, namely literacy, previous exposure and attitude, cause the asymmetry in mutual intelligibility in adults. In this paper, we investigate what attitudes adults and preschoolers hold towards the neighbouring language, and whether there is a relationship between attitudes held towards the neighbouring language and abilities to decode it. Attitude elicitation from 45 Danish-speaking and 39 Swedish-speaking participants revealed that attitudes change with age, but individual reaction time measurements towards 50 auditorily presented cognate nouns in a multiple-choice picture-pointing task showed no significant correlation with individual attitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates one of several factors suggested to cause the well-documented asymmetry in mutual intelligibility between spoken Danish and Swedish. Danes have consistently been reported to decode more items in spoken Swedish than vice versa. There is evidence that spoken Danish contains more optional and obligatory reduction processes than spoken Swedish does. Having a rather conservative orthography compared to Swedish, these reductions are often not reflected in the written form. We assume therefore that, if literate speakers of Danish and Swedish can activate their orthographic knowledge as an additional cue during word recognition of the neighbouring language, this enhances word recognition in both groups, but speakers of Danish confronted with spoken Swedish profit to a larger extent than vice versa. To test whether L1 orthography is activated during spoken word recognition of a closely related L2, we present 29 literate speakers of Danish and 27 literate speakers of Swedish with 110 auditory stimuli divided in two conditions in a translation task. The +O condition contains stimuli whose native spelling is consistent with non-native pronunciation and the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂO condition contains stimuli whose native spelling is inconsistent with non-native pronunciation. Importantly, all L2 items are inconsistent with L1 pronunciation, as they differ in exactly one phoneme such as Swedish tolv /tolv/ and Danish tolv /tol/ ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtwelveÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. Results reveal that translations of +O items were more accurate than those of ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂO items, and that +O items elicit a negativity that occurred time-locked to the inconsistency and that was largest at centro-posterior electrodes, suggesting that participants activated their native orthography during spoken word recognition of the neighbouring language.},

In addition, 838 subjects were followed over the 7-year interval. Markers of perceptual speed were the Identical Pictures and Finding A's tests from the ETS Kit of Factor-Referenced Tests. Significant age differences, age changes, and cohort differences were found at both observed variable and latent construct levels. Cross-lagged correlations examine the role of perceptual speed in predicting later performance on other abilities (Verbal Meaning, Inductive Reasoning, Spatial Orientation, Number, and Word Fluency). When perceptual speed is partialled out of scores for these abilities, aging effects are reduced markedly for all abilities, but least for Spatial Orientation and Inductive Reasoning.},

It asks in what way the fact of being a speaker of a non-dominating language community influences the perception of the own competence and of the evaluation of the different standard varieties of the pluricentric language. By examining the attitudes towards Swiss Standard German in German-speaking Switzerland it argues that speakers of non-dominating language communities often have the notion that their own standard variety being deficient combined with a feeling of lingual inferiority towards the speakers of the dominating community. Thus, the standard variety of the dominating community serves as a prestigious variety. In Switzerland these attitudes strongly correlate with the age of the acquisition of Standard German and the negative attitudes towards Germans. Finally the paper raises the question whether the concept of pluricentricity can adequately be used when there ist no awareness of pluricentricity among the speakers. The data presented derives from two empirical studies conducted in Switzerland in the summer of 2003: a survey on language attitudes and a subjective evaluation test.},

  Abstract                 = {Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Emigration usually requires speakers to become bilingual, and eventually they may even become dominant in their second language. This can lead to a gradual loss of proficiency in the first language, a phenomenon referred to as first language attrition. As migrants become elderly, however, they sometimes report a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂreversionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in language dominance, whereby the second language, which they have used in their daily lives for years or decades, recedes and the first language becomes stronger again. There are largely anecdotal cases of communication between such speakers and their children who were not brought up to speak their parents' first language becoming impossible. It is, however, very difficult to separate fact from fiction in such reports. This article will give an overview of changes in lexical access and fluency in the first language of adult migrants. It will assess simplistic predictions for a linear development of first and second languages against a more complex perspective which takes into account psycholinguistic aspects of activation, inhibition, and cognitive ageing. The predictions made on this basis will be tested on a large-scale quantitative investigation of language proficiency among migrants of German and Dutch descent in the Netherlands and Canada},

It is now possible to use meta-analysis to show that reliance on significance testing retards the development of cumulative knowledge.

Teachers must revamp their courses to bring students to understand that (a) reliance on significance testing retards the growth of cumulative research knowledge; (b) benefits widely believed to flow from significance testing do not in fact exists; and (c) significance testing methods must be replacec with point estimates and confidence intervals in individual studies and with meta-analyses in the integration of multiple studies.

All students answered the same questionnaire on (4 components of) metacognitive knowledge of reading. The aim was to explore the relative contributions to NL and FL reading comprehension of a language-specific predictor (vocabulary knowledge) and of general metacognitive knowledge. Results of analyses of covariance structure show that metacognitive knowledge was not entirely implicated in vocabulary knowledge. For older students (grades 8 and 10), metacognitive knowledge appeared to play a significant role in both NL and FL reading comprehension. These findings suggest that, in the educational setting investigated, poorer students in grades 6 to 8, not having spontaneously acquired metacognitive knowledge of reading, stand a good chance of profiting from instruction in this type of knowledge. Furthermore, we found evidence for the so-called threshold hypothesis, according to which (metacognitive) knowledge of reading strategies, reading goals and text characteristics cannot compensate for a lack of language-specific knowledge if the latter remains below a certain threshold level. The limited FL knowledge “short-circuits” the transfer of reading skills to the FL.},

In order to evaluate a newly developed viewing comprehension test 485 German high school students completed reading, listening, and viewing comprehension tests, all measuring the receptive proficiency in English as a foreign language. Fluid and crystallized intelligence were measured as predictors of performance. Relative to traditional comprehension tasks, the viewing comprehension task has similar psychometric qualities. The three comprehension tests are very highly but not perfectly correlated with each other. Relations with fluid and crystallized intelligence show systematic differences between the three comprehension tasks. The high overlap between foreign language comprehension measures and between crystallized intelligence and language comprehension ability can be taken as support for a uni-dimensional interpretation. Implications for the assessment of language proficiency are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This article is a defence of the Full Transfer/Full Access (FT/FA) model.
FT/FA hypothesizes that the initial state of L2 acquisition is the final state of L1 acquisition (Full Transfer) and that failure to assign a representation to input data will force subsequent restructurings, drawing from options of UG (Full Access).
We illustrate the FT/FA model by reviewing our analysis of the developmental Turkish-German Interlanguage data of Schwartz and Sprouse (1994) and then turn to other data that similarly receive straightforward accounts under FT/FA.

We also consider two other competing hypotheses, both of which accept Full Access but not Full Tranfer: the Minimal Trees hypotheis (no transfer of functional categories) of Vainikka and Young-Scholten (1994; 1996) and the Weak Transfer hypothesis (no transfer of the values associated with functional categories) of Eubank (1993/94).
We provide an example of (extremely robust) L2 acquisition data that highlight the inadequacy of the Minimal Trees hypothesis in regard to stages of Interlanguage subsequent to the L2 initial state.
As for Weak Transfer, we show that the morphosyntactic empirical foundations which drive the entire approach are flawed; hence the Weak Transfer hypothesis remains without motivation.

Finally, we consider several conceptual issues relating to transfer.
These all argue that the FT/FA model provides the most coherent picture of the L2 initial cognitive state.
In short, FT/FA embodies the most suitable programme for understanding comparative Interlanguage development.},

  Abstract                 = {What are the effects of a word's orthographic neighborhood on the word recognition process? S. Andrews (1989) reported that large neighborhoods facilitate lexical access (the neighborhood size effect). J. Grainger, J. K. O'Regan, A. M. Jacobs, & J. Segui (1989) reported that higher frequency neighbors inhibit lexical access (the "neighborhood frequency effect"). Because neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency typically covary (words with large neighborhoods will usually possess higher frequency neighbors), these findings would seem to contradict one another. In the present study, 6 experiments on the effects of neighborhood size and neighborhood frequency indicated that, at least for low-frequency words, large neighborhoods do facilitate processing. However, the existence of higher frequency neighbors seems to facilitate rather than inhibit processing. The implications of these findings for serial and parallel models of lexical access are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, the effects of second language (i.e., L2) proficiency and age of second language acquisition are assessed. Three types of bilinguals are compared: Early L2 learners, Late highly proficient L2 learners, and Late less proficient L2 learners. A lexical decision priming paradigm is used in which the critical trials consist of first language (i.e., L1) Spanish targets preceded by English (L2) primes. Three types of L2-L1 priming conditions were used: Semantic primes [e.g., PRIME=nail; TARGET=TORNILLO ("screw")], Mediated Form primes [e.g., PRIME=bull ("toro"); TARGET="TOR"NILLO], and Form primes (e.g., PRIME="torture"; target="TOR"NILLO). Semantic and Mediated Form primes produced facilitative priming effects for the Early group, but not for either of the Late groups. Highly proficient Late learners showed inhibitory effects of Form primes, whereas the less proficient group produced no priming effects of any type. The pattern of priming effects is consistent with an interactive activation architecture in which the semantic/conceptual level is shared by L1 and L2 for Early learners, versus a shared lexical level for proficient Late learners. The implication is that age of L2 acquisition has a major influence on how bilinguals represent and access words in their second language.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (<= .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reportin dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have provided conflicting evidence concerning the question of whether irrelevant information can facilitate the processing of relevant information in a choice reaction time task. Results of the present study demonstrated that indications of facilitation and/or interference were dependent on the context in which baseline trials were administered. Three groups of 24 subjects pressed a left- or right-handed key in response to the onset of an X or O that was accompanied by a monaural or binaural tone. The monaural tone provided an irrelevant directional cue since, on some trials, it was ipsilateral to the correct response (corresponding trials), while, on other trials, it was contralateral (noncorresponding trials). When binaural (baseline) trials were presented in the same block as the monaural trials, data suggested that the directional cue produced both facilitation and interference. However, when baseline trials were presented in one block, and corresponding and noncorresponding trials were mixed together in another block, data suggested an interference effect only. The difference was attributed to differences in the degree of stimulus uncertainty within a block of trials.},

I, 32 undergraduates pressed keys located to the right or left of the body midline in response to monaurally presented tonal commands signifying right- or left-hand responses. Ss performed on both uncrossed- and crossed-arms trials. Results indicate that ear-response-location correspondence was the crucial factor accounting for S-R compatibility. In Exp. II, 32 Ss responded with the right or left hand, depending on the ear in which a monaural tone was presented. Ss followed both corresponding and noncorresponding ear-hand instructions on uncrossed- and crossed-arms trials. Results indicate that both ear-hand correspondence and ear-response-location correspondence contributed to S-R compatibility.},

The role of spatial cues in the process of translating display information into control action was discussed. The predicted interaction of task difficulty and age was not significant.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a widespread belief, both in the scientific world and in society at large, that the way in which and the extent to which one learns a language is dependent on one's age. Reference is constantly made to the notions of 'speech milestones'---predictable age-related stages in early language development---and 'critical period'---a maturational 'window of opportunity' beyond the bounds of which language acquisition is claimed to be impossible or qualitatively different. This book examines the evidence relative to the idea that there is an age factor in first and second language acquisition, evidence that has sources ranging from studies of feral children to evaluations of language programmes in primary schools. It goes on to explore the various explanations that have been advanced to account for such evidence. Finally, it looks at the educational ramifications of the age question, with particular regard to formal second language teaching in the early school years and in 'third age' contexts.},

Working memory includes two components: short-term storage (on the order of seconds) and executive processes that operate on the contents of storage. Recently, these two components have been investigated in functional neuroimaging studies. Studies of storage indicate that different frontal regions are activated for different kinds of information: storage for verbal materials activates Broca's area and left-hemisphere supplementary and premotor areas; storage of spatial information activates the right-hemisphere premotor cortex; and storage of object information activates other areas of the prefrontal cortex. Two of the fundamental executive processes are selective attention and task management. Both processes activate the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.},

In three tasks (reinterpreting ambiguous auditory images, parsing meaningful letter strings, scanning familiar melodies) subjects relied on a partnership between the inner ear and inner voice, one similar to the phonological loop system described in the short-term memory literature. Apparently subjects subvoeally rehearsed the imagery material, which placed the material in a phonological store that allowed the imagery judgement. In a fourth task (distinguishing voiced and unvoiced consonants in imagery), subjects still subvoeally rehearsed, but seemed to need no additional phonological store to respond correctly. In this ease they may have consulted articulatory or kinesthetic cues instead. In a fifth experiment (making homophone judgements), subjects hardly even needed to subvoeally rehearse, a result suggesting that homophone judgements rely on some direct route from print to phonology. We consider the breadth of the partnership between the inner ear and inner voice, the level that subvoeal rehearsal occupies in the cognitive system, and the functional neuroanatomy of the phonological loop system.},

  Abstract                 = {Research has demonstrated working memory improves during childhood and supports vocabulary, grammar, and reading development (Adams & Gathercole, 1995, 1996; Bowey, 1996; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989, 1990). Prior to the addition of the episodic buffer in BaddeleyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs model of working memory (2000a), auditory and visual aspects of working memory were often treated separately without evaluating contributions from the ability to integrate the two forms of information. The present study was designed to investigate the development of visual-verbal integration in working memory and its role in language and reading development. Tests of receptive vocabulary, receptive grammar, and decoding ability were administered to 46 children between 6 and 10 years of age. Working memory was assessed with a paired associates task where stimuli varied based on modality and contributions from long-term memory were limited by using nonwords and unfamiliar images. Data from the same tests of language and working memory were also available for 58 children between 3 and 5 years of age (Robinson & Smith, 2005) and included in exploratory analyses. Developmental findings were consistent with previous studies in indicating the unimodal aspects of working memory improve steadily across the entire age range examined. Growth curve analyses of cross-modal working memory, which taxed the episodic buffer, showed curvilinear growth where spans increased rapidly between 3 and 7 years of age then appeared to slow dramatically. Analyses of residuals support the notion of integrative growth above and beyond changes in unimodal working memory. Although cross-modal working memory did not make significant contributions to decoding ability, it accounted for 11% of unique variance in receptive grammar scores in schoolaged children.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been considerable debate about the relevance and applicability of SLA theory and research for L2 pedagogy. There are those who maintain that SLA must be applicable to L2 pedagogy: a view based on the argument that because SLA is a subfield of applied linguistics, it should have direct relevance to L2 teaching. Others take the view that not all areas of SLA research need to be relevant to L2 pedagogy ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ only the more ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂappliedÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ areas. While I would agree that much of the work in SLA should be applicable to L2 pedagogy, particularly research on instructed SLA, my presentation takes a different perspective on the SLA/L2 pedagogy interface. It focuses on MISAPPLICATIONS of SLA theory and research to L2 pedagogy. I argue that the applicability of SLA research for L2 instruction requires a careful consideration of context and that specific SLA constructs ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ even those considered to be important within instructed SLA ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ may not have direct RELEVANCE to L2 pedagogy. Three areas of SLA research that I will discuss with respect to misapplication and relevance are: the role of instruction in SLA, the role of age in SLA, and the nature of and distinction between implicit and explicit L2 knowledge.},

Few attempts have been made to explicitly assess the predictive power of the two frameworks against each other. We evaluated the extent to which age changes in performance in executive function tasks (involving response selection, response suppression, working memory, and adaptive control) depend on age-related changes in global information-processing speed. Our sample consisted of children, adolescents, adults and seniors. Analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling revealed a mixed pattern of results. Controlling for global speed removed the child vs. adult differences in the speed of responding on the executive function tasks but the senior vs. adult differences remained. This mixed pattern of findings was interpreted to suggest that the effects of advancing age on the speed of responding are mediated by a global mechanism during childhood but during senescence the efficiency of executive functioning seems particularly vulnerable to the effects of age.},

  Abstract                 = {This is the first comprehensive synthesis and general implications of the two-factor theory of cognitive abilities, which states that when the "tetrad difference" (between the cross-products in a rectangle of coefficients between four abilities) does not depart significantly (as judged in the light of its probable error) from zero, these abilities may be separated (mathematical proof is presented in the appendix) into a general factor g, common to all the abilities, and special factors s, appertaining to each separately. After several historical and critical chapters opposing the general-ability ("monarchic"), faculty or type ("oligarchic"), and average or general-level ("anarchic") concepts of cognition, the sequelae of the tetrad equation are explored. This is accurately satisfied by a majority of mental-test abilities, but not by physical measurements, etc. In cases where agreement is not close due to overlapping s's ("group factors") further inquiry brings to light other general factors besides g, such as c, the obverse of mental inertia or perseveration, "oscillation," apparently a fatigue function, and w, a semi-temperamental function akin to volition. The s's which remain are believed to be related to the particular sensory or motor apparatus involvedÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthe "engines" in which g, the quantity of "energy" (of which the inertia and oscillation are also attributes) is expressed. The "engineer" is a requirement of the system to which the conative w concept seems to be fitted. Several chapters show the applicability of the two-factor concept to the elements of the author's analysis of cognition, such as education, clearness and speed, span, etc.; retentivity, however, was found to be independent of g},

Thirty-one younger adults and 29 older adults named all of these words, and age differences in the influence of these factors were examined. The results revealed that all 3 factors predicted reliable amounts of variance in word-naming latencies for both groups. However, older adults showed a larger influence of word frequency and reduced influences of orthographic length and orthographic neighborhood density compared with younger adults. Overall, these results suggest that lexical level factors increase in influence in older adults whereas sublexical factors decrease in influence.},

The results show that there are considerable schooling effects on all tests, including the tests of fluid intelligence, and that schooling effects explain almost all of the intellectual progress made during 1 year of life at that age, measured by the increase in the mean scores of the tests.},

This practice makes the probability of erroneously rejecting H0 different for the reader than for the investigator. It introduces two biases in the interpretation of the scientific literature: one due to multiple repetiion of studies with false hypothesis, and one due to failure to publish smaller and less significant outcomes of tests of a true hypotheses. These practices distort the results of literature surveys and of meta-analyses. These results also indicate that practice leading to publication bias have not changed over a period of 30 years.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. Results We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. Conclusion The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

  abstract  = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2 studies, the authors used a combination of psychometric and experimental techniques to investigate the effects of domain-general and domain-specific working memory factors on offline decisions concerning attachment of an ambiguous relative clause. Both studies used English and Dutch stimuli presented to English- and Dutch-speaking participants, respectively. In Study 1, readers with low working memory spans were less likely to use recency strategies for disambiguation than were readers with high spans. This finding is inconsistent with predictions of locality- and resource-based accounts of attachment. Psychometric analyses showed that both domain-specific (verbal) and domain-general working memory accounted for the effect. Study 2 found support for the hypothesis that segmentation strategies imposed during silent reading can account for the counterintuitive relationship. Results suggest that readers with low spans have a greater tendency to break up large segments of text because of their limited working memory, leading to high attachment of the ambiguous relative clause.},

The nature of the code in which this match takes place was examined in two experiments. The first experiment looked at arrditory lexical processing and found that nonwords took longer to classify as nonwords if they formed the beginnings of real words, regardless of syllable structure. This was in contrast to a second experiment which employed a visual lexical decision task, where nonwords took longer to classify only if they formed the first syllable of a word. It was concluded that the access code that activates lexical information in spoken word recognition is the first few phonemes regardless of syllable structure, whereas in printed word recognition the access code is the first (orthographically defined) syllable.},

Previous studies of this phenomenon have used the variable rule program, a generalized linear model; however, recent developments in statistics have introduced new tools, including mixed-effects models, random forests, and conditional inference trees that may open additional possibilities for data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. In a step-by-step demonstration, we show how this well-known variable benefits from these complementary techniques. Mixed-effects models provide a principled way of assessing the importance of random-effect factors such as the individuals in the sample. Random forests provide information aboutthe importance of predictors, whether factorial or continuous, and do so also for unbalanced designs with high multicollinearity, cases for which the family of linear models is less appropriate. Conditional inference trees straightforwardly visualize how multiple predictors operate in tandem. Taken together, the results confirm that polarity, distance from verb to plural element, and the nature of the DP are significant predictors. Ongoing linguistic change and social reallocation via morphologization are operational. Furthermore, the results make predictions that can be tested in future research. We conclude that variationist research can be substantially enriched by an expanded tool kit.},

  Abstract                 = {An experiment is reported in which the relationships between simple learning by accretion and various cognitive ability variables are explored. Seven sources of individual differences were hypothesized to underlie proficiency in simple learning by accretion: declarative knowledge, strategic knowledge, working memory, lexical processing speed, metacognition, semantic inference, and incidental learning capacity. Computerized tests of these sources were administered to a sample of 714 Air Force recruits along with a trigram-English word pair associate task which was presented as a foreign language vocabulary learning task. Subjects were assigned at random to three groups: control, semantic elaboration, and interactive imagery. Subjects in the semantic elaboration group were instructed to generate sentences to link the trigram and word in a memorable way. Subjects in the interactive imagery group were given the additional instruction of visualizing the generated sentence. Trigram consonant vowel consonants (CVCs) varied in meaningfulness across the two lists of eight pairs in the task. Results showed that meaningfulness and strategy had the expected main effects on learning. In addition, strategy interacted with verbal knowledge in initial learning such that high knowledge learners benefited more than low knowledge learners from either strategy. Regression analyses showed that a representative measure from each proposed source made a significant unique contribution to the explained variance in paired associate learning. The system of causal relationships is further examined through a path analysis. The results are discussed in reference to a general individual differences model of learning.},

  Abstract                 = {A well-known problem in the domain of quantitative linguistics and stylistics concerns the evaluation of the lexical richness of texts. Since the most obvious measure of lexical richness, the vocabulary size (the number of different word types), depends heavily on the text length (measured in word tokens), a variety of alternative measures has been proposed which are claimed to be independent of the text length. This paper has a threefold aim. Firstly, we have investigated to what extent these alternative measures are truly textual constants. We have observed that in practice all measures vary substantially and systematically with the text length. We also show that in theory, only three of these measures are truly constant or nearly constant. Secondly, we have studied the extent to which these measures tap into different aspects of lexical structure. We have found that there are two main families of constants, one measuring lexical richness and one measuring lexical repetition. Thirdly, we have considered to what extent these measures can be used to investigate questions of textual similarity between and within authors. We propose to carry out such comparisons by means of the empirical trajectories of texts in the plane spanned by the dimensions of lexical richness and lexical repetition, and we provide a statistical technique for constructing confidence intervals around the empirical trajectories of texts. Our results suggest that the trajectories tap into a considerable amount of authorial structure without, however, guaranteeing that spatial separation implies a difference in authorship.},

The results indicated that, in contrast with findings of Browne (1982) for French learners of English, spoken cognates were significantly easier to identify than written cognates for learners of any grade, and leaners improved cognate inferencing skills in reading significantly more than those in listening over time. The results were parallel with outcomes fo a symmetrical study Uchida and Nakamura (2000) with English-speakin learners of Japanese.

  Abstract                 = {We present an easy-to-administer and automated version of a popular working memory (WM) capacity task (operation span; Ospan) that is mouse driven, scores itself, and requires little intervention on the part of the experimenter. It is shown that this version of Ospan correlates well with other measures of WM capacity and has both good internal consistency (alpha = .78) and test--retest reliability (.83). In addition, the automated version of Ospan (Aospan) was shown to load on the same factor as two other WM measures. This WM capacity factor correlated with a factor composed of fluid abilities measures. The utility of the Aospan was further demonstrated by analyzing response times (RTs) that indicated that RT measures obtained in the task accounted for additional variance in predicting fluid abilities. Our results suggest that Aospan is a reliable and valid indicator of WM capacity that can be applied to a wide array of research domains.},

  abstract  = {In the Color-Word Stroop test (CWST), the basic task is to name the ink color or rows of XXXs, and performance in this condition is compared with performance in naming the ink-color of color words under conditions where word meanings and ink colors mismatch or are incongruent (e.g., the word red printed in green ink). The present study investigated whether Stroop test interference, defined as the cost associated with ink-color naming in the incongruous stimulus condition versus in the basic color-naming condition, provides positive evidence for a kind of processing qualitatively different than that which is required for color naming or for word reading. Does the pattern of age-related differences in Stroop interference force the conclusion that the incongruous condition taps a qualitatively different kind of processing than that required for color naming or for word reading? We gave the CWST to 310 healthy adults. Their performance in each condition of the test replicates and extends previous findings. Structural equation modeling of the data showed a significant, direct link between age and performance in the latent factor associated with the incongruent condition. However, this direct link with age produced a relatively small increase in the model's fit; it amounted to only a .024 increase in the proportion of variance explained in the incongruous condition. In light of this small direct influence due to age, the most parsimonious explanation of our findings is that age effects in Stroop interference are due to age-related slowing (which is also indexed by color naming and by word reading) primarily; the findings do not provide positive evidence for a qualitatively different kind of processing that declines with age.},

We used the cognate-facilitation effect as a marker of cross-lingual activations in both languages. Cognates (e.g., Dutch-English schip [ship]) and controls were presented in a sentence context, and eye movements were monitored. Results showed faster reading times for cognates than for controls. Thus, this study shows that one of peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs most automated skills, reading in oneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs native language, is changed by the knowledge of a second language.},

We selected 43 very advanced late learners of Dutch (native speakers of German, French and Turkish) and compared their performance on a grammar test with that of 44 native speakers of Dutch. The test consisted of an elicited imitation task and a sentence preference task. In these tasks, participants were tested on their knowledge of dummy subject constructions. These construction types are known to be very hard to acquire for L2-learners of Dutch and are hardly covered in Dutch grammars or L2 Dutch textbooks. The results show that it is possible to attain a native level of proficiency for learners who start acquiring an L2 after puberty, even for leaners with a typologically distant L1.},

  Abstract                 = {In contrast to survey interviews, qualitative interviews are seldom reanalyzed. Besides obvious reasons such as ownershipÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂand especially the culture of individualistic ownershipÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthat impede reusing data, there is also methodological skepticism about secondary analysis. In this paper, I will argue in favor of sharing qualitative data on behalf of secondary analysis. The argument is partly based onÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂand much inspired byÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthe discussions during the preparation of a collaborative project of thirteen researchers who were invited to analyze the same set of interview data from their own theoretical/methodological viewpoint (VAN DEN BERG, WETHERELL & HOUTKOOP-STEENSTRA, 2003). During these discussions several methodological arguments against secondary analysis were put forward. In this paper I will deal with some of these arguments, especially the doubts about the usefulness of secondary analysis and the argument concerning the assumed risk of decontextualization: Is secondary analysis possible without in-depth knowledge of the context? Different theoretical and methodological positions concerning the contextualization of interview discourse will be scrutinized. On the one hand I argue against the tendency to include the ever-widening societal and historical context on behalf of the analysis of interview discourse. This tendency runs the risk of speculative social theorizing as a framework for interpreting interview discourse. On the other hand I do not think that the neglect of every social context outside interview talkÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂas advocated by some strands within conversation analysisÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂis fruitful or even possible. This neglect runs the risk of abstract empiricism. The main argument is that the kind and measure of contextualization of interview data needed on behalf of discourse analysis should depend on the research goal and the type of data.

Responses were much slower for elderly than for young participants. The delay in trials in which stimulus and response side did not correspond as compared to when they did correspond (the Simon effect) was larger for older people, even after correcting for general slowing due to aging. The slowing of responses reflected a slowing of internal processing, as indicated by progressively larger delays of the peak latencies of the N1, the posterior contralateral negativity (PCN), and P3. A comparison between the amplitudes of the PCN and early lateralized readiness potential (pre-LRP) indicated that transmission from posterior sites (PCN) to the motor cortex may be affected by age. The data support the view that aging affects an inhibitory process that controls direct visuomotor transmission.},

Students' reading comprehension, their linguistic knowledge (vocabulary and grammar knowledge) and processing efficiency (speed of word recognition and sentence comprehension) in both languages, and their metacognitive knowledge about reading were assessed. The relative strengths of the effects of these components of reading were analyzed to distinguish among 3 hypotheses about the relationship between L1 and L2 reading comprehension: the transfer hypothesis, the threshold hypothesis, and the processing efficiency hypothesis. The transfer hypothesis predicts a strong relationship between L1 and L2 reading comprehension and a strong effect of metacognitive knowledge on L2 reading comprehension, whereas the threshold and processing efficiency hypotheses predict a more important role of language-specific knowledge and processing skills. Results support the transfer hypothesis, although language-specific knowledge and fluency also contribute to L2 reading performance.},

  abstract  = {This study introduces a new paradigm for investigating lexical processing. First, an analysis of data from a series of word-spotting experiments is presented suggesting that listeners treat vowels as more mutable than consonants in auditory word recognition in English. In order to assess this hypothesis, a word reconstruction task was devised in which listeners were required to tum word-like nonwords into words by adapting the identity of either one vowel or one consonant. Listeners modified vowel identity more readily than consonant identity. Furthermore, incorrect responses more often involved a vowel change than a consonant change. These findings are compatible with the proposal that English listeners are equipped to deal with vowel variability by assuming that vowel identity is comparatively underdefined. The results are discussed in the light of theoretical accounts of speech processing.},

One possible explanation for this difference is based upon their respective acoustic/articulatory characteristics. Another way of accounting for the findings would be to relate them to the differential functioning of vowels and consonants in the syllabic structure of words. In this experiment, we examined the second possibility. Targets were two pairs of phonemes, each containing a vowel and a consonant with similar phonetic characteristics. Subjects heard lists of English words and had to press a response key upon detecting the occurrence of a pre-specified target. This time, the phonemes which functioned as vowels in syllabic structure yielded shorter reaction times than those which functioned as consonants. This rules out an explanation for response time difference between vowels and consonants in terms of function in syllabic structure. Instead, we propose that consonantal and vocalic segments differ with respect to variability of tokens, both in the acoustic realisation of targets and in the representation of targets by listeners.},

While German distinguishes between masculine, feminine, and neuter gender, the masculine–feminine distinction has nearly disappeared in Standard Dutch. Many substandard Belgian Dutch varieties, however, still mark this distinction, making them more akin to German than Standard Dutch in this respect. Seventy-one Belgian and 104 Netherlandic speakers of Dutch with varying levels of German proficiency assigned gender-marked German articles to German nouns with Dutch cognates; these gender assignments were then compared to the cognates’ gender in the standard and substandard L1 varieties. While the gender assignments of both Belgian and Dutch participants were strongly influenced by the cognates’ Standard Dutch gender, the Belgians’ responses showed, at best, weak traces of the masculine–feminine distinction in substandard Belgian Dutch. Possible reasons for this weak substandard variety influence are discussed.},

To this end, 159 German-speaking Swiss participants aged 10 to 86 were asked to translate 45 written and 45 spoken isolated Swedish words with German, English or French cognates. In addition, they were administered an English language test, a German vocabulary test as well as fluid intelligence and working memory tests. Cognate guessing skills were found to improve into young adulthood, but whereas they show additional increases in the written modality throughout adulthood, they start to decrease from age 50 onwards for spoken stimuli. Congruently with these findings, L1 vocabulary knowledge is a stronger predictor of written cognate guessing success, whereas fluid intelligence is the most important predictor in the spoken modality.

  Abstract                 = {Background Sharing of raw research data is common in many areas of medical research, genomics being perhaps the most well-known example. In the clinical trial community investigators routinely refuse to share raw data from a randomized trial without giving a reason. Discussion Data sharing benefits numerous research-related activities: reproducing analyses; testing secondary hypotheses; developing and evaluating novel statistical methods; teaching; aiding design of future trials; meta-analysis; and, possibly, preventing error, fraud and selective reporting. Clinical trialists, however, sometimes appear overly concerned with being scooped and with misrepresentation of their work. Both possibilities can be avoided with simple measures such as inclusion of the original trialists as co-authors on any publication resulting from data sharing. Moreover, if we treat any data set as belonging to the patients who comprise it, rather than the investigators, such concerns fall away. Conclusion Technological developments, particularly the Internet, have made data sharing generally a trivial logistical problem. Data sharing should come to be seen as an inherent part of conducting a randomized trial, similar to the way in which we consider ethical review and publication of study results. Journals and funding bodies should insist that trialists make raw data available, for example, by publishing data on the Web. If the clinical trial community continues to fail with respect to data sharing, we will only strengthen the public perception that we do clinical trials to benefit ourselves, not our patients.},

  abstract  = {In a classic 1978 Memory & Cognition article, Geoff Loftus explained why noncrossover interactions are removable.
These removable interactions are tied to the scale of measurement for the dependent variable and therefore do not allow unambiguous conclusions about latent psychological processes.
In the present article, we present concrete examples of how this insight helps prevent experimental psychologists from drawing incorrect conclusions about the effects of forgetting and aging.
In addition, we extend the Loftus classification scheme for interactions to include those on the cusp between removable and nonremovable.
Finally, we use various methods (i.e., a study of citation histories, a questionnaire for psychology students and faculty members, an analysis of statistical textbooks, and a review of articles published in the 2008 issue of Psychology and Aging) to show that experimental psychologists have remained generally unaware of the concept of removable interactions.
We conclude that there is more to interactions in a 2 by 2 design than meets the eye.},

A stimulus could occur on the left or right, or above or below a fixation point. Ss performed with their hands uncrossed or crossed. Compatibility effects were found to hold between the position of the stimulus and that of the response key, whether or not the hands were crossed. Thus the effects did not depend on the relation between a stimulus and a particular motor output. It was hypothesized that the positions of both the stimulus and the responding hand were related to a spatial code, and the outcome of a comparison between their representations in this code was responsible for the differences in compatibility. Results of Exp. II suggest that there were both facilitation and interference in the compatible and incompatible situations, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Following estimation of effects from a linear mixed model, it is often useful to form predicted values for certain factor/variate combinations. The process has been well defined for linear models, but the introduction of random effects into the model means that a decision has to be made about the inclusion or exclusion of random model terms from the predictions. This paper discusses the interpretation of predictions formed including or excluding random terms. Four datasets are used to illustrate circumstances where different prediction strategies may be appropriate: in an orthogonal design, an unbalanced nested structure, a model with cubic smoothing spline terms and for kriging after spatial analysis. The examples also show the need for different weighting schemes that recognize nesting and aliasing during prediction, and the necessity of being able to detect inestimable predictions.},

This hypothesis was tested in a large-scale study manipulating reading experiences of adults over several weeks. The group receiving relative clause experience increased reading speeds for object relatives more than for subject relatives, whereas a control experience group did not. The reading time data were compared to performance of a computational model given different amounts of experience. The results support claims for experience-based individual differences and an important role for statistical learning in sentence comprehension processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Dutch is a typical 'third language'. Most learners have knowledge of other languages before they start to learn Dutch. One or two of these languages are closely related to Dutch, English and/or German. When L3-learners come across a new language for the first time, it can be observed that they try to make use of languages they learned before. Experienced language learners of- ten perform better than less experienced subjects. Furthermore, prior research shows that related languages will contribute more to intelligibility than less related languages do. The objects of this study were 42 German multilinguals reading a Dutch text without knowledge of this language. They mainly differ according to their language background and language learning experience. The results indicate that the experienced learners use more inferring strategies than the less expe- rienced learners and that German is indeed the preferred source of transfer. However, the experienced multilinguals do not show a significantly different metalinguistic strategy pattern, and some regard Scandinavian words as being much more transferable than one might expect. This leads to the assumption that their explicit knowledge about language relatedness and their linguistic knowledge is not fully available in reading comprehension. Finally, the author offers some suggestions as to the direction explanations might take.},

Research on bilingualism has focused on (visual) word recognition of homographs, homophones and cognates and supports an overlapping bilingual memory model. This overlap must be expected in multilinguals as well and must lead to a rather complex model. This article discusses the concepts of language distance (measurement) and mental lexicon (models) from the perspective of the intercomprehensional skills of 'real' subjects reading a text in an unknown language Dutch with little - though quite regular - distance to their L1 (German) and L2 (English). The author points at some effects that text construction, dominant language networks and phonetic reading ability may have on cognate recognition.},

The findings of three experiments examining the pattern of intrusion errors in the Stroop task revealed that older adults were more likely to experience lapses than were younger adults, and that lapses tended to be of longer duration in older than younger adults. Lapses were observed under conditions of suboptimal controlled attentional processing, when task conditions required the allocation of this processing in the service of multiple behavioral goals, and during periods of slowed responding. The findings of these experiments are consistent with those from a growing number of studies indicating that older adults are more susceptible to lapses of intention than younger adults.},

Somen theorists have suggested that this increase results from a decline in the ability to inhibit word information on incongruent trials, whereas others have suggested that the decline reflects general slowing. These two hypotheses were evaluatd using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) measured while younger and older adults performed the Stroop task. As expected, the Stroop effect was greater for older than younger adults. The ERP data revealed a selective age-related attenuation of two modulations reflecting the inhibition of word information on incongruent trials. Latency of the P3 wave did not increase to a greater extend [sic] for older than younger adults from the congruent to incongruent trials as expected based on the general slowing hypothesis. Taken together, these findings support the inhibitory deficit hypothesis by demonstrating an age-related decline in a conceptual level inhibitory process that supports the suppression of word information in the Stroop task.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of studies have reported that there is a negative correlation between age of L2 acquisition and performance on a variety of measures of L2 ability, and that individuals who begin learning an L2 after approximately 15 years of age fail to attain native-like levels of competence. These results have been interpreted as support both for the hypothesis that there is a critical period for L2 acquisition and for the hypothesis that there is a maturational decline in access to Universal Grammar (UG). We argue that extant results are not an adequate test of the critical periods hypothesis because they are based on the performance of learners who have not necessarily achieved native-like proficiency in the L2. In this study, we develop criteria to establish whether an L2 speaker has achieved native-like proficiency. We compare the performance of three groups (near-native speakers of English, non-native speakers and controls) on two tasks designed to tap aspects of UG which have been claimed to be subject to critical period effects. We found no significant differences between our near-native group and native speakers on either of the tasks. We conclude that native-like competence in an L2 is achievable, even by older L2 learners.},

Reasons for not sharing data are discussed and contrasted with advantages of sharing, which include abiding by the scientific principle of openness, keeping the data for posterity, increasing one's impact, facilitation of secondary analyses and collaborations, prevention and correction of errors, and meeting funding agencies' increasingly stringent stipulations concerning he dissemination of data. Practicing what they preach, the authors include data as an online appendix to this editorial. These data are from a cohort of psychology freshmen who completed Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, tests of Numerical Ability, Number Series, Hidden Figures, Vocabulary, Verbal Analogies, and Logical Reasoning, two Big Five personality inventories, and scales for social desirability and impression management. Student's sex and grade point average (GPA) are also included. Data could be used to study predictive validity of cognitive ability tests, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and the general factor of personality, as well as sex differences, differential prediction, and relations between personality and intelligence.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authorsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically. Methods and Findings: We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance. Conclusions: Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

  Abstract                 = {With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer-review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. Reviewers with higher average ratings are weighted more heavily in publication decisions, thereby ensuring academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. This leads to a transparent basis for editorial hierarchies and prevents politically inspired editorial appointments. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical cherry-picking and data massaging to obtain favorable results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses. Therefore it leads to a publication system that more fully benefits from the advantages and possibilities offered by online, open access publication.},

  Abstract                 = {In general, discussion of cross-linguistic influence has focussed almost exclusively on the role of L1 in L2 production, both in the form of crosslinguistic influence on the learner's interlanguag and in the form of language switches to the L1 during L2 production As yet, there has been little work done on the influence of a learner's other previously learned L2s in the acquisition of a new language (L3) The few studies that have been earned out on the role of L2 in L3 production however show that L2 does play an important role in L3 acquisition. This paper presents the results of ongoing research on non-adapted language switches, using data from a two-year longitudinal case study of an adult learner of L3 Swedish with L1 English and L2 German Our study is, based on 844 non-adapted language switches We indentified four main types of switch, three of which had pragmatic purpose, namely (1) EDIT (marking self-repair, beginning of turntake etc), (II) META (used for asides, to comment on L3 performance or ask for help) and (III) INSERT (use of non-L3 items to overcome lexical problems in L3), and the last of which we refer to as Without Idenufied Pragmatic Purpose (WiPP Switch, of ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂnon-intentional switchesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ, Pouhsse and Bongaerts 1994) We found that While L1 English prevailed in EDIT, META and INSERT functions, almost only L2 German occurred in WIPP Switches Most of these WIPP Switches were function words We also noticed that a number of the English utterances used in INSERT function appeared to show German Influence, although this was not the case when English was used in META function Our results, show that in this case study of L3 acquisition, L1 and L2 play different roles We suggest that L2 German, Which was shown to be the non-L3 language predominantly used to supply material for lexical construction attempts in the L3 (Williams and Hammarberg 1994), is activated in Parallel to the L3 interlanguage, underlying L3 production and even L1 production We refer to this as the default supplier role L1 English, on the other hand, is more seldom used in lexical construction attempts in the L3 or activated in parallel but rather is kept separate from the L3 and used largely with a metalinguistic function We refer to this as the INSTRUMENTAL role We propose a developmental model of L3 production based on de Bot's (1992) model of bilingual speech production but involving role assignment to the background languages, such that only the language which has been assigned the role of DEFAULT SUPPLIER' is regularly activated in parallel to the L3 interlanguage Over time, these two roles are largely taken over by the L3 itself We suggest that these roles also exist in L2 acquisition but since there is only one background language, this takes over both roles and over distinctions between them collapse.},

Detailed code for all analyses is described using packages for the freeware R.},

This usually justifies the preference for longitudinal studies over cross-sectional ones, because the former allow the modelling of the dynamic process generating the outcome, while the latter cannot. Supporters of the longitudinal view make two interrelated claims: (i) causal inference requires following the same individuals over time, and (ii) no causal inference can be drawn from cross-sectional data. In this paper, we challenge this view and offer counter-arguments to both claims. We also argue that the possibility of establishing causal relations does not so much depend upon whether we use longitudinal or cross-sectional data, but rather on whether or not the modelling strategy is structural.},

Comparison between contemporary WM models reveals: (1) consensus that the content of WM includes not only task-relevant information, but also task-irrelevant information; (2) consensus that WM consists of phonological and visuospatial components; (3) consensus that short-term memory storage is a function of WM; (4) disagreement as to whether an independent executive control is a necessary WM component; and (5) disagreement as to whether the control function is active or passive. Methods for measuring WM differed across studies with a preponderance of various dual-tasks; little psychometric work has been done on these measures. Correlational studies supported a close relationship between WM and measures of fluid intelligence and science achievement, but we found no experimental studies on the impact ofWMtraining on science achievement. Finally we suggest how WM research findings may be applied to improve fluid intelligence and science achievement.},

I believe that this necessary statistical procedure is effect size analysis, and without it, I believe that we fail to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth when describing our neuropsychological research. Accordingly, I review here the standard calculations of commonly employed effect sizes in two group designs and show how to adjust some familiar (and perhaps not so familiar) formulae using illustrative numerical examples. I also put forth an argument to adopt Cohen's measure as an expression of effect size based on its apropos to neuropsychological research. It is also argued that the interpretation of the magnitude of an effect size should depend on context, and not on pre-established heuristic benchmarks. It is noted, however, that effect sizes greater than 3.0 (OL%<5) might seem particularly appropriate when evaluating the sensitivity of neuropsychological tasks and in establishing test markers in neuropsychological disorders.},

Although both age groups were sensitive to interpretation cues, young adults were likely to produce the intended interpretation, but older participants generalized across all actions. The results of Experiment 2 replicated this pattern under conditions in which subjects received more practice and misleading contextual information was removed. Experiment 3 tested whether older adultsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ tendency to generalize was due to the retrieval requirements of production by using a verification task. Older participants did not differ from the young in verifying intended interpretations but were at chance in rejecting generalizations, suggesting that older adults may have a deficit in semantic processing.},

The most conspicuous difference is that the German children seem on the right track with respect to the uninflected adjective, whereas the Turkish and Moroccan Arabic children fossilise the inflected variant. It is argued that the L1 background cannot explain this difference and in general only plays a marginal role in the acquisition of Dutch determiners and adjectival inflection.

  abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker’s /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker’s /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (a) recognizing previously encountered situations, (b) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (c) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (a) to (c) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on 2 critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires that listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these 2 aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},

Target fragments (which were unconstrained as to whether the relative pronoun permitted high or low attachment) were preceded by constrained prime fragments, which were either structurally congruent with the targets (Experiments 1 and 2) or structurally incongruent with the targets (anaphoric adverbial clauses rather than relative clauses (RCs), Experiment 3). While the first two experiments established reliable repetition of RC attachments between primes and targets, Experiment 3 failed to obtain a significant priming effect, indicating that RC attachment priming is dependent on a syntactic overlap between primes and targets. The results suggest a tendency of language producers to retain hierarchical syntactic relations over consecutive trials. Current models of syntactic priming in production do not offer an explanatory mechanism for this kind of observation as they presently stand.},

temporarily ambiguous constructions. The ambiguity concerned whether a relative clause (RC) that appeared after a
complex noun phrase (NP) was interpreted as modifying the first or the second noun in the complex NP (El polic´ıa arrest´o a
la hermana del criado que estaba enferma desde hac´ıa tiempo). The results showed that whereas the Spanish monolingual
speakers and the Spanish–English bilinguals with limited exposure reliably attached the relative clause to the first noun, the

models of sentence parsing most consistent with the findings.},

listeners can adapt to novel talkers and accents with appropriate experience.
Previous studies have demonstrated talker-independent but
accent-dependent learning after training on multiple talkers from a single
language background. Here, listeners instead were exposed to talkers
from five language backgrounds during training. After training, listeners
generalized their learning to novel talkers from language backgrounds
both included and not included in the training set. These
findings suggest that generalization of foreign-accent adaptation is the
result of exposure to systematic variability in accented speech that is
similar across talkers from multiple language backgrounds.},

  abstract  = {This study examines the interpretation of constituent wh-questions in L2 English by learners whose L1 is Austrian German. Austrian German and English share identical surface word order patterns for a range of question forms, but with distinct semantic interpretations. Non-target patterns of interpretation show that the learners ay high levels of proficiency continue to optionally parse English questions with the L1 syntax. The continued presence of thematic verb movement and head-final VP syntax in L1 German-L2 English interlanguagechallenges previous findings that headedness is reset very early and that V2 is realised by auxiliary verbs. This is analysed as an instance of Variational Learning (Yang, 2002), whereby the L1 grammar is accessed to parse L2 input where possible. The L1 syntactic representation thus continues to be available at high proficiency levels to parse input strings that are linearly compatible, giving rise in the case of L1 German-L2 English to non-target parses and interpretation of wh-questions.},

L1 English-speaking learners’ comprehension of L2 German questions and relative clauses is tested on the basis of a picture interpretation task. Patterns of (mis)interpretation of the German clauses suggest that lower-intermediate proficiency learners still access the L1 syntax in order to parse L2 input. This is taken to indicate that learners are influenced by L1 word order patterns in assigning thematic roles in L2 clauses. This is discussed in light of approaches to L2 parsing and processing which attribute different roles to L1 influence.},

This question was explored in two experiments that examined the extent to which readers who learn a new construction are able to extend it to sentence contexts other than the one in which it initially appeared. Readers were trained on the needs construction (“The meal needs cooked given that dinner is in an hour”) and then were presented with examples of the construction in a different sentential context (“John thinks that what the meal needs is cooked given that dinner is in an hour”). The results show that readers have little difficulty comprehending the needs construction in the new context, even when the construction is used with a different verb. These findings are discussed with respect to theories of structural priming and sentence processing.},

When hearing an ambiguous sound between /s/ and /f/ in lexically unambiguous contexts such as gira[s/f], listeners learn to interpret the sound as /f/ because gira[f] is a real word and gira[s] is not. Later, they apply this learning even in lexically ambiguous contexts (perceiving knife rather than nice). Although such retuning could help listeners adapt to foreign-accented speech, research has focused on single phonetic contrasts artificially manipulated to create ambiguous sounds; however, accented speech varies along many dimensions. It is therefore unclear whether analogies to adaptation to accented speech are warranted. In the present studies, the to-be-adapted ambiguous sound was embedded in a global foreign accent. In addition, conditions of cross-speaker generalization were tested with focus on the extent to which perceptual similarity between 2 speakers’ fricatives is a condition for generalization to occur. Results showed that listeners retune phoneme categories manipulated within the context of a global foreign accent, and that they generalize this short-term learning to the perception of phonemes from previously unheard speakers. However, generalization was observed only when exposure and test speakers’ fricatives were sampled across a similar perceptual space.},

Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the PDP by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data-generating model. Through simulated examples and real datasets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

Perceptual processing speed was tracked by measuring reaction times to visual probe words following each sentence. Three experiments using Spanish- and Chinese-accented speech indicate that processing speed is initially slower for accented speech than for native speech but that this deficit diminishes within one minute of exposure. Control conditions rule out explanations for the adaptation effect based on practice with the task and general strategies for dealing with difficult speech. Further results suggest that adaptation can occur within as few as two to four sentence-length utterances. The findings emphasize the flexibility of human speech processing and require models of spoken word recognition that can rapidly accommodate significant acoustic-phonetic deviations from native language speech patterns.},

  abstract  = {Verbs often participate in more than 1 syntactic structure, but individual verbs can be biased in terms of whether they are used more often with 1 structure or the other. For instance, in a sentence such as “Bop the bunny with the flower,” the phrase “with the flower” is more likely to indicate an instrument with which to “bop,” rather than which “bunny” to bop. Conversely, in a sentence such as “Choose the cow with the flower,” the phrase “with the flower” is more likely to indicate which “cow” to choose. An open question is where these biases come from and whether they continue to be shaped in adulthood in a way that has lasting consequences for real-time processing of language. In Experiment 1 we replicated previous findings that these language-wide biases guide online syntactic processing in a computer-based visual-world paradigm. In Experiment 2, we tested the malleability of these biases by exposing adults to initially unbiased verbs situated in unambiguous contexts that led to either instrument or modifier interpretations. During test, participants interpreted sentences containing either modifier- or instrument-trained verbs in ambiguous contexts. Eye-movement and action data show that participants’ considerations of the candidate interpretations of the ambiguous with-phrases were guided by the newly learned verb biases. These results suggest that co-occurrence information about specific verbs and syntactic structures embedded in language experiences plays a role in forming, and continuously shaping, the verb biases that constitute a part of the broader representation of the language.},

In two eye-tracking experiments, participants received auditory instructions to move objects around a screen from two randomly alternating spatial perspectives (45° vs. 315° or 135° vs. 225° rotations from the participant’s viewpoint). Instructions were spoken either by one voice, where the speaker’s perspective switched at random, or by two voices, where each speaker maintained one perspective. Analysis of participant eye-gaze showed that interpretation of the instructions improved when each viewpoint was associated with a different voice. These findings demonstrate that listeners can learn mappings between individual talkers and viewpoints, and use these mappings to guide online language processing.},

However, in intelligibility research, the effect of age has not been investigated as extensively. Apart from Vanhove’s (2014) investigation of the effect of age on cognate guessing, almost no other studies have paid attention to this factor. Also, in intelligibility research, the effect of educational level on intelligibility is often neglected as most studies only test either pre-university or university students. This paper examines the potential effect of age and level of education on intelligibility. In contrast to Vanhove (2014), we looked at text intelligibility instead of cognate recognition. We tested 2760 Danish participants in a written or spoken cloze test in Dutch, English, German or Swedish, where they had to fill gaps in a text. The participants varied in age and educational background. We found that both age and level of education affect intelligibility scores. However, for the spoken cloze test education did not have a significant effect on intelligibility scores for Dutch and Swedish. Additionally, age had no significant effect on age for Dutch as a test language. For education we found that people with a higher level of education perform better on the test than participants with a lower level of education.},

The predictive role of these two dimensions of vocabulary knowledge in relation to the vocabulary component of the assessment was also examined. The extent to which vocabulary knowledge at various word-frequency levels predicted overall descriptive writing performance as well as scores on the vocabulary component was investigated. For this purpose, 67 English as a Foreign Language students took the Vocabulary Levels Test, Word Associates Test, and undertook two descriptive writing tasks. Results of correlations and stepwise regressions indicated that (a) vocabulary breadth was predictive of overall assessment of descriptive writing while vocabulary depth only correlated with the overall assessment; (b) vocabulary breadth was also predictive of the vocabulary component of L2 descriptive writing, but vocabulary depth was again simply correlated with this variable and (c) while mid-frequency vocabulary was correlated with, and predictive of, the overall assessment of descriptive writing, knowledge of low-frequency words was a strong factor in explaining the variance in the vocabulary component. The results are explained with reference to the emphasis on lexical diversity and sophistication in the vocabulary assessment criteria.},

The goal of these studies is to better understand the relationship between linguistic features of essays and human judgements of writing quality. Coh-Metrix reports on a wide range of linguistic features, affording analyses of writing at various levels of text structure, including surface, text-base, and situation model levels. Recent studies have examined linguistic features of essay quality related to co-reference, connectives, syntactic complexity, lexical diversity, spatiality, temporality, and lexical characteristics. These studies have analysed essays written by both first language and second language writers. The results support the notion that human judgements of essay quality are best predicted by linguistic indices that correlate with measures of language sophistication such as lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity. In contrast, human judgements of essay quality are not strongly predicted by linguistic indices related to cohesion. Overall, the studies portray high quality writing as containing more complex language that may not facilitate text comprehension.},

proficiency essays can be predicted by linguistic indices of 
cohesion
 (i.e., 
coreference and connectives), 
syntactic complexity
 (e.g., number of words 
before the main verb, sentence structure overlap), the 
diversity of words
used by the writer, and 
characteristics of words
 (e.g., frequency, concreteness, 
imagability). The three most predictive indices of essay quality in this study 
were syntactic complexity (as measured by number of words before the 
main verb), lexical diversity (as measured by the Measure of Textual Lexical 
Diversity), and word frequency (as measured by Celex, logarithm for all 
words). Using 26 validated indices of cohesion from Coh-Metrix, none 
showed differences between high- and low-proficiency essays and no indices 
of cohesion correlated with essay ratings. These results indicate that the 
textual features that characterize good student writing are not aligned with 
those features that facilitate reading comprehension. Rather, essays judged to 
be of higher quality were more likely to contain linguistic features associated 
with text difficulty and sophisticated language.},

Results from the random-effects model of the five remaining studies indicate a small positive effect (g = 0.23; 95\% confidence interval [0.10, 0.36]) for bilingual over submersion programs on reading of language minority children. Thus, this meta-analysis supports bilingual education—that is, including the home language of language minority children—in school instruction. However, the generalizability of the results is limited by the small number of studies on this topic. More published studies on bilingual education in Europe are needed as well as closer attention to the size of the effects.},

Much remains to be known, however, about the relationship between language proficiency, specifically lexical proficiency, and reader judgments of the overall quality of timed essays. This study reports on the role of the lexical component as one factor in holistic scoring. Sixty-six placement essays written by students from mixed language backgrounds in the intermediate to advanced range of an intensive English program were holistically scored. These quality scores were then compared to four lexical richness measures: lexical variation, error-free variation, percentage of lexical error, and lexical density. High, significant correlations were found for (a) lexical variation, that is, the ratio of the number of different lexical items to the total number of lexical items in the essay adjusted to length; and (b) lexical variation minus error. The latter measure, error-free variation, correlated best with score.},

samples of written texts, although a satisfactory description of L2 writing remains
problematic. Even when variables such as proficiency, language background, topic, and
audience have been controlled, straightforward predictive relationships between linguistic
variables and quality ratings have remained elusive, and perhaps they always will. We
propose a different approach. Rather than assuming a linear relationship between linguistic
features and quality ratings, we explore multiple profiles of highly rated timed compositions
and describe how they compare in terms of their lexical, grammatical, and discourse
features. To this end, we performed a cluster analysis on two sets of timed compositions to
examine their patterns of use of several linguistic features. The purpose of the analysis was
to investigate whether multiple profiles (or clusters) would emerge among the highly rated
compositions in each data set. This did indeed occur. Within each data set, the profiles of
highly rated texts differed significantly. Some profiles exhibited above-average levels for
several linguistic features, whereas others showed below-average levels. We interpret the
results as confirming that highly rated texts are not at all isometric, even though there do
appear to be some identifiable constraints on the ways in which highly rated timed
compositions may vary.},

The rationales of both approaches are delineated and two procedures are given for estimating the sample size from the AIPE perspective for a two-group mean comparison. One method yields the required sample size, such that the expected width of the computed confidence interval will be the value specified. A modification allows for a defined degree of probabilistic assurance that the width of the computed confidence interval will be no larger than specified.

  abstract  = {Different speakers may pronounce the same sounds very differently, yet listeners have little difficulty perceiving
speech accurately. Recent research suggests that listeners adjust their preexisting phonemic categories to accommodate
speakers’ pronunciations (
perceptual learning
). In some cases, these adjustments appear to reflect general changes to
phonemic categories, rather than speaker-specific adjustments. But what happens when listeners encounter multiple
speakers with different pronunciations? We exposed listeners to two speakers who varied in their pronunciation of a
particular phoneme (Experiment 1: /d/ or /t/; Experiment 2: /s/ or /
S
/). Listeners then categorized sounds on /d/-/t/
or /s/-/
S
/ continua, in the same two voices. The results suggest that perceptual experience leads to very different learning
for different types of phonemic contrasts. For fricatives, perceptual learning was speaker-specific: The system was able
to maintain multiple different representations simultaneously. In contrast, perceptual learning for stop consonants
resulted in more general changes that required the system to re-adjust when a new pronunciation was encountered.},

sounds. A phenomenon termed ‘perceptual learning for speech’ shows that listeners also
use top-down information to adjust perceptual boundaries in subsequent processing of

well understood. Of interest is whether boundary shifts arise because of a retuning of pho-
netic sensitivities early in the neural processing stream or whether they result from deci-
sion-related or attentional mechanisms further downstream. In the current study,
activation was measured using fMRI as participants underwent a behavioral replication
of this paradigm. Sensitivity to boundary shifts emerged in right frontal and middle tem-
poral regions, implicating adjustments of perceptual criteria downstream from primary
auditory cortex. Later in the session, this same sensitivity emerged in left superior tempo-
ral areas, implicating a slowly-adapting system in regions of the brain related to phonetic
processing.},

  abstract  = {Listeners rapidly adjust to talkers’ pronunciations, accommodating those pronunciations
into the relevant phonemic category to improve subsequent perception. Previous work
has suggested that such learning is restricted to pronunciations that are representative
of how the speaker talks (Kraljic, Samuel, & Brennan, 2008). If an ambiguous pronunciation,
for example, can be attributed to an external source (such as a pen in the speaker’s mouth),
or if it is preceded by normal pronunciations of the same sound, learning is blocked.
In three experiments, we explore this blocking effect in more detail. Our aim is to better
understand the nature of the representations underlying the perceptual learning process.
Experiment 1 replicates the blocking effect. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that it can
be eliminated when certain visual information occurs simultaneously with the auditory
signal. The pattern of learning and non-learning is best accounted for by the view that
speech perception is mediated by episodic representations that include potentially rele-
vant visual information.},

  abstract  = {Past research has established that listeners can accommodate a wide range of talkers in
understanding language. How this adjustment operates, however, is a matter of debate.
Here, listeners were exposed to spoken words from a speaker of an American English dia-
lect in which the vowel /  / is raised before /g/, but not before /k/. Results from two exper-
iments showed that listeners’ identification of /k/-final words like back (which are
unaffected by the dialect) was facilitated by prior exposure to their dialect-affected /g/-
final counterparts, e.g., bag. This facilitation occurred because the competition between
interpretations, e.g., bag or back, while hearing the initial portion of the input [b  ], was
mitigated by the reduced probability for the input to correspond to bag as produced by this
talker. Thus, adaptation to an accent is not just a matter of adjusting the speech signal as it
is being heard; adaptation involves dynamic adjustment of the representations stored in
the lexicon, according to the characteristics of the speaker or the context.},

The frequencies of rejection under the null hypothesis conformed closely to the expected number of rejections at four different alpha levels. The alternate ranks design is especially recommended for experimenters who anticipate difficulties meeting ANCOVA assumptions. Interpretation of results is also facilitated by matching groups in this manner.},

These three predictions were evaluated using longitudinal reading and writing data from 233 French–Portuguese and German–Portuguese bilingual children. Results show that prediction (1) is borne out but predictions (2) and (3) are not. The discussion centres on the vast array of possible results that are compatible with the interdependence hypothesis in correlational studies, particularly if it is combined with post hoc thresholds. Our conclusion is that current forms of the interdependence hypothesis do not offer a fruitful framework for further investigation.},

Data were collected with 2,357 college students who were native speakers of European Portuguese. The participants rated 100 words drawn randomly from the full set for each of the three subjective indices, using a Web survey procedure (via a URL link). Analyses comparing the MWP ratings with those obtained for the same words from other national and international databases showed that the MWP norms are reliable and valid, thus providing researchers with a useful tool to support research in all neuroscientific areas using verbal stimuli.

Focusing on the data entry and storage aspects, this paper offers practical recommendations for organizing spreadsheet data to reduce errors and ease later analyses. The basic principles are: be consistent, write dates like YYYY-MM-DD, don't leave any cells empty, put just one thing in a cell, organize the data as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), create a data dictionary, don't include calculations in the raw data files, don't use font color or highlighting as data, choose good names for things, make backups, use data validation to avoid data entry errors, and save the data in plain text file.},

(Standard jackknife theory gives an approximate mean and variance in the case R(X,F)=θ(F^)−θ(F),θ some parameter of interest.) A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap. The exposition proceeds by a series of examples: variance of the sample median, error rates in a linear discriminant analysis, ratio estimation, estimating regression parameters, etc.},

Whilst there are fundamental theoretical and philosophical differences between both schools of thought, we argue that in two most common situations the practical differences are negligible when off-the-shelf Bayesian analysis (i.e., using ‘objective’ priors) is used. We emphasize this reasoning by focusing on interval estimates: confidence intervals and credible intervals. We show that this is the case for the most common empirical situations in the social sciences, the estimation of a proportion of a binomial distribution and the estimation of the mean of a unimodal distribution. Numerical differences between both approaches are small, sometimes even smaller than those between two competing frequentist or two competing Bayesian approaches. We outline the ramifications of this for scientific practice.},

Results showed no group differences in overall reaction times as well as in the Simon effect thus providing no evidence that an executive control advantage is related to differences in cultural and ethnic background as was found for immigrant compared to non-immigrant bilinguals, nor that executive control may be improved by use of dialect. We suggest the role of interactional contexts and bilingual literacy as potential explanations for inconsistent findings of a bilingual advantage in executive control.},

In two unpublished replications of this study designed to verify the appropriate testing procedures, Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, and Holland observed a smaller difference between conditions (2\%–3\%) as well as a gender difference: Men showed the effect (9.3\% and 7.6\%), but women did not (0.3\% and −0.3\%). The procedure used in those replications served as the basis for this multilab Registered Replication Report. A total of 40 laboratories collected data for this project, and 23 of these laboratories met all inclusion criteria. Here we report the meta-analytic results for those 23 direct replications (total N = 4,493), which tested whether performance on a 30-item general-knowledge trivia task differed between these two priming conditions (results of supplementary analyses of the data from all 40 labs, N = 6,454, are also reported). We observed no overall difference in trivia performance between participants primed with the “professor” category and those primed with the “hooligan” category (0.14\%) and no moderation by gender.},

We address one aspect of this problem that stems from the use of balance tests in conjunction with
experimental data. When random assignment is botched, due either to mistakes in implementation or
differential attrition, balance tests can be an important tool in determining whether to treat the data as
observational versus experimental. Unfortunately, the use of balance tests has become commonplace in
analyses of “clean” data, that is, data for which random assignment can be stipulated. Here, we show that
balance tests can destroy the basis on which scientific conclusions are formed, and can lead to erroneous
and even fraudulent conclusions. We conclude by advocating that scientists and journal editors resist the
use of balance tests in all analyses of clean data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract  = {In this study, a corpus of essays stratified by level (9th grade, 11th grade, and college freshman) are analyzed computationally to discriminate differences between the linguistic features produced in essays by adolescents and young adults. The automated tool Coh-Metrix is used to examine to what degree essays written at various grade levels can be distinguished from one another using a number of linguistic features related to lexical sophistication (i.e., word frequency, word concreteness), syntactic complexity (i.e., the number of modifiers per noun phrase), and cohesion (i.e., word overlap, incidence of connectives). The analysis demonstrates that high school and college writers develop linguistic strategies as a function of grade level. Primarily, these writers produce more sophisticated words and more complex sentence structure as grade level increases. In contrast, these writers produce fewer cohesive features in text as a function of grade level. This analysis supports the notion that linguistic development occurs in the later stages of writing development and that this development is primarily related to producing texts that are less cohesive and more elaborate.},

The procedure for obtaining values for D directly from transcripts using software (vocd) is introduced, and then applied to thirty-two children from the Bristol Study of Language Development (Wells 1985) at ten different ages. A significant developmental trend is shown for D and an indication is given of the average scores and ranges to be expected between the ages of 18 and 42 months and at 5 years for these L1 English speakers. The meaning attributable to further ranges of values for D is illustrated by analysing the lexical diversity of academic writing, and its wider application is demonstrated with examples from specific language impairment, morphological development, and foreign/second language learning.},

Key to this analysis is the use of the computational tool Coh-Metrix, which measures cohesion and text difficulty at various levels of language, discourse, and conceptual analysis, and a statistical method known as discriminant function analysis. Results show that L1 and L2 written texts vary in several dimensions related to the writer's use of lexical choices. These dimensions correlate to lexical depth of knowledge, variation, and sophistication. These findings, together with the relevance of the new computational tools for the text analysis used in the study, are discussed.},

Key to this analysis is the inclusion of linguistic measures at the surface, textbase and situation model level that assess text cohesion and linguistic sophistication. The results of this study demonstrate that five variables (lexical diversity, word frequency, word meaningfulness, aspect repetition and word familiarity) can be used to significantly predict L2 writing proficiency. The results demonstrate that L2 writers categorised as highly proficient do not produce essays that are more cohesive, but instead produce texts that are more linguistically sophisticated. These findings have important implications for L2 writing development and L2 writing pedagogy.},

In the case of two factors, three separate null hypotheses are subject to test (i.e., two main effects and one interaction). Consequently, the probability of at least one Type I error (if all null hypotheses are true) is 14 % rather than 5 %, if the three tests are independent. We explain the multiple-comparison problem and demonstrate that researchers almost never correct for it. To mitigate the problem, we describe four remedies: the omnibus F test, control of the familywise error rate, control of the false discovery rate, and preregistration of the hypotheses.},

In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology’s academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result—a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label “confirmatory,” and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled “exploratory.” We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception.},

This claim is quite popular in the literature. The aim of this paper is to argue against the claim and to develop an alternative explanation of why computer simulations resemble experiments. To this purpose, experiment is characterized in terms of an intervention on a system and of the observation of the reaction. Thus, if computer simulations are experiments, either the computer hardware or the target system must be intervened on and observed. I argue against the first option using the non-observation argument, among others. The second option is excluded by e.g. the over-control argument, which stresses epistemological differences between experiments and simulations. To account for the similarities between experiments and computer simulations, I propose to say that computer simulations can model possible experiments and do in fact often do so.},

whether German native speakers use case and prosody together to anticipate post-verbal
arguments. In Experiment 1, participants heard subject-first and object-first sentences containing
either case and prosodic cues or only case cues in a single mixed block. In Experiments 2 and 3,
sentences were presented in separate blocks, such that participants heard sentences with
prosodic cues in either Block 1 (Experiment 3) or Block 2 (Experiment 2). The results show that
participants used prosodic and case-marking cues additively to anticipate post-verbal arguments.
Additive effects varied according to the distribution of the cues and their order of presentation.
We conclude that the presence of multiple redundant cues facilitates sentence processing and
that the parser adapts to the utility of cues based on their availability.},

The delay will be experimentally induced by the presentation of sentences spoken to listeners in a foreign or a regional accent as part of a lexical decision task for words placed at the end of sentences. Using a blocked design of accents presentation, Experiment 1 shows that accent changes cause a temporary perturbation in reaction times, followed by a smaller but long-lasting delay. Experiment 2 shows that the initial perturbation is dependent on participants’ expectations about the task. Experiment 3 confirms that the subsequent long-lasting delay in word identification does not habituate after repeated exposure to the same accent. Results suggest that comprehensibility of accented speech, as measured by reaction times, does not benefit from accent exposure, contrary to intelligibility.},

Here, we examined two positional effects in lexically guided retuning. In Experiment 1, ambiguous sounds during exposure always appeared in word-initial position (replacing the first sounds of /f/- or /s/-initial words). No retuning was found. In Experiment 2, the same ambiguous sounds always appeared word-finally during exposure. Here, retuning was found. Lexically guided perceptual learning thus appears to emerge reliably only when lexical knowledge is available as the to-be-tuned segment is initially being processed. Under these conditions, however, lexically guided retuning was position independent: It generalized across syllabic positions. Lexical retuning can thus benefit future recognition of particular sounds wherever they appear in words.},

In a newly developed paradigm, speakers differed in the probabilities by which they used particular sentence structures. Probe trials were applied to infer participants’ syntactic expectations for a given speaker and to track changes of these expectations over time. The results show that listeners fine-tune their linguistic expectations according to the individual language style of a speaker. Strikingly, nine months after the initial experiment these highly specific expectations could be rapidly reactivated when confronted with the particular language style of a speaker but not merely on the basis of an association with speaker identity per se. These findings highlight that communicative interaction fine-tunes and consolidates interlocutor specific communicative predictions which can overrule strong linguistic priors.},

We investigate whether Brazilian (BP) and European Portuguese (EP) speakers adapt to variations in the probability of occurrence of ambiguous overt and null pronouns, in two experiments assessing resolution toward subject and object referents. For each variety (BP, EP), participants were faced with either the same number of null and overt pronouns (equal distribution), or with an environment with fewer overt (than null) pronouns (unequal distribution). We find that the preference for interpreting overt pronouns as referring back to an object referent (object-biased interpretation) is higher when there are fewer overt pronouns (i.e., in the unequal, relative to the equal distribution condition). This is especially the case for BP, a variety with higher prior frequency and smaller object-biased interpretation of overt pronouns, suggesting that participants adapted incrementally and integrated prior statistical knowledge with the knowledge obtained in the experiment. We hypothesize that comprehenders adapted rationally, with the goal of maintaining, across variations in pronoun probability, the likelihood of subject and object referents. Our findings unify insights from research in pronoun resolution and in adaptation, and add to previous studies in both topics: They provide evidence for the influence of pronoun probability in pronoun resolution, and for an adaptation process whereby the language processor not only tracks statistical information, but uses it to make interpretational inferences.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

study, the effects of residualizing predictor variables are demonstrated and discussed using
ordinary least-squares regression and mixed-effects models. Some of these effects are
almost certainly not what the researcher intended and are probably highly undesirable.
Most importantly, what residualizing does not do is change the result for the residualized
variable, which many researchers probably will find surprising. Further, some analyses
with residualized variables cannot be meaningfully interpreted. Hence, residualizing is
not a useful remedy for collinearity.},

of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent
variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb – most commonly the
rule of 10 – associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or
serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical
textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the
collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression
to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index.
These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems
more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and
find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of
several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF
of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analy-
ses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest
the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.},

procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—
colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association
away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using
unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for
mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather
always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this
caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

We found that the ratings could to a substantial degree be predicted on the basis of these indices and that the accuracy with which the ratings of shorter texts could be predicted was comparable to that of longer texts. For French and German, the greatest predictive power was attained by opaque models with scores of predictors, but models with fewer predictors based on a 6-dimensional framework of lexical richness perception or even with a single, easily computed predictor, Guiraud’s index, fared only slightly worse.},

Even when the native (L1) samples and second-language (L2) samples are comparable in terms of age, socio-economic status, educational background and the like, these nativelikeness estimates are difficult to interpret theoretically. This is so because it is not known how often other native speakers would be labeled as non-nativelike if judged by the same standards: if some other native speakers were to be labeled as non-nativelike, then it is possible that some second-language learners that were categorized as non-nativelike are actually nativelike. Two methods for estimating the classification error rate in nativelikeness categorizations – one conceptually straightforward but practically arduous, and one involving the re-analysis of the original studies’ data – are proposed. These approaches underscore that, even if one conceives of nativelikeness as a binary category (nativelike vs. non-nativelike), the data collected in any given study may not allow for such neat categorizations.},

  abstract  = {Empirical studies in psychology commonly report Cronbach’s alpha as a measure of internal consistency reliability despite the fact that many methodological studies have shown that Cronbach’s alpha is riddled with problems stemming from unrealistic assumptions. In many circumstances, violating these assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are. Although methodological critiques of Cronbach’s alpha are being cited with increasing frequency in empirical studies, in this tutorial we discuss how the trend is not necessarily improving methodology used in the literature. That is, many studies continue to use Cronbach’s alpha without regard for its assumptions or merely cite methodological articles advising against its use to rationalize unfavorable Cronbach’s alpha estimates. This tutorial first provides evidence that recommendations against Cronbach’s alpha have not appreciably changed how empirical studies report reliability. Then, we summarize the drawbacks of Cronbach’s alpha conceptually without relying on mathematical or simulation-based arguments so that these arguments are accessible to a broad audience. We continue by discussing several alternative measures that make less rigid assumptions which provide justifiably higher estimates of reliability compared to Cronbach’s alpha. We conclude with empirical examples to illustrate advantages of alternative measures of reliability including omega total, Revelle’s omega total, the greatest lower bound, and Coefficient H. A detailed software appendix is also provided to help researchers implement alternative methods.},

These are exciting new directions for the field, assisted in no small part by the adoption of mixed-effects modelling techniques that enable the partitioning of among- and within-individual behavioural variation. It has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example, between a personality trait and other individual traits such as cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from these individual-level point estimates. We briefly summarize the problems with such statistical methods that are used regularly by behavioural ecologists, and highlight the robust solutions that exist within the mixed model framework, providing tutorials to aid in their implementation.},

The idea of a bilingual advantage may result from a publication bias favoring studies with positive results over studies with null or negative effects. To test this hypothesis, we looked at conference abstracts from 1999 to 2012 on the topic of bilingualism and executive control. We then determined which of the studies they reported were subsequently published. Studies with results fully supporting the bilingual-advantage theory were most likely to be published, followed by studies with mixed results. Studies challenging the bilingual advantage were published the least. This discrepancy was not due to differences in sample size, tests used, or statistical power. A test for funnel-plot asymmetry provided further evidence for the existence of a publication bias.},

We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

  abstract  = {Covariate adjustment is common in the analysis of randomised trials, and can increase statistical power without increasing sample size. Published research on covariate adjustment, and guidance for choosing covariates, focusses on trials where individuals are randomised to treatments. In cluster randomised trials (CRTs) clusters of individuals are randomised. Valid analyses of CRTs account for the structure imposed by cluster randomisation. There is limited published research on the e ects of covariate adjustment, or guidance for choosing covariates, in analyses of CRTs. I summarise existing guidance for choosing covariates in individually randomised trials and CRTs, and review the methods used to investigate the e ects of covariate adjustment. I review the use of adjusted analyses in published CRTs. I use simulation, analytic methods, and analyses of trial data to investigate the e ects of covariate adjustment in mixed models. I use these results to form guidance for choosing covariates in analyses of CRTs. Guidance to choose covariates a priori and adjust for covariates used to stratify randomisation is also applicable to CRTs. I provide guidance speci c to CRTs using linear and logistic mixed models. Cluster size, the intra-cluster correlations (ICCs) of the outcome and covariate, and the strength of the relationship between the outcome and covariate in uence the power of adjusted analyses and the precision of treatment e ect estimates. An a priori estimate of the product of cluster size and the ICC of the outcome can be used to assist choosing covariates. When this product is close to one, adjusting for a cluster level covariate or a covariate with a negligible ICC provide similar increases in power. For smaller values of this product, adjusting for a cluster level covariate gives minimal increases in power. The use of separate withincluster and contextual covariate e ect parameters may increase power further in some circumstances.},

The difficulty of the estimation problem arises from the fact that it involves missing posttest data. The gain score and the covariance adjustment estimator both use the pretest to predict these missing data, but in different ways: The gain score estimator treats the pretest as a baseline and the covariance adjustment estimator treats it as a covariate. Using a result by D. B. Rubin (1977), it is shown that, if the assignment is not on the basis of the pretest, there is no basis for preferring the covariance adjustment estimator over the gain score estimator. Contrary to what is sometimes suggested, regression toward the mean is not a reason for not using the gain score estimator; neither is measurement error in the pretest, unless the assignment is affected by the pretest.},

  abstract  = {Background and Objective
For inferring a treatment effect from the difference between a treated and untreated group on a quantitative outcome measured before and after treatment, current methods are analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the outcome with the baseline as covariate, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of change from baseline. This article compares both methods on power and bias, for randomized and nonrandomized studies.

Methods
The methods are compared by writing both as a regression model and as a repeated measures model, and are applied to a nonrandomized study of preventing depression.

Results
In randomized studies both methods are unbiased, but ANCOVA has more power. If treatment assignment is based on the baseline, only ANCOVA is unbiased. In nonrandomized studies with preexisting groups differing at baseline, the two methods cannot both be unbiased, and may contradict each other. In the study of depression, ANCOVA suggests absence, but ANOVA of change suggests presence, of a treatment effect. The methods differ because ANCOVA assumes absence of a baseline difference.

Conclusion
In randomized studies and studies with treatment assignment depending on the baseline, ANCOVA must be used. In nonrandomized studies of preexisting groups, ANOVA of change seems less biased than ANCOVA, but two control groups and two baseline measurements are recommended.},

The most common way to evaluate the effect of an intervention is to compare the intervention and nonintervention groups regarding the change in the outcome variable between baseline and follow-up; however, there are many different ways to define “changes.” The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how different definitions of “change” used in the analysis can influence the results of a study.

Study design and setting
Two different randomized controlled trials were used as examples.

Results
The results of the analyses showed that for continuous outcome variables, analysis of covariance seems to be the most appropriate because it corrects for the phenomenon of regression to the mean. For dichotomous outcome variables, multinomial logistic regression analysis with all possible changes over time as outcome seems to be the most appropriate, especially because of its straightforward interpretation.

Conclusion
A different definition of “change” can lead to different results in the evaluation of the effect of an intervention.},

This study examines two distinct cluster randomization designs: (1) the repeated cross‐sectional design in which centres are followed over time but patients change, and (2) the longitudinal design in which individual patients are followed over time within treatment clusters. Simulations of each study design stipulated a multiplicative treatment effect (on the log odds scale), between 5 and 15 clusters in each of two treatment arms, and followed over two time periods. Estimation options included linear mixed effects models using restricted maximum likelihood (REML), generalized estimating equations (GEE), mixed effects logistic regression using both penalized quasi likelihood (PQL) and numerical integration, and Bayesian Monte Carlo analysis. For the repeated cross‐sectional designs, most methods performed well in terms of bias and coverage when clusters were numerous (30) and variability across clusters of baseline risk and treatment effect was modest. With few clusters (two groups of five) and higher variability, only the Bayesian methods maintained coverage. In the longitudinal designs, the common methods of REML, GEE, or PQL performed poorly when compared to numerical integration, while Bayesian methods demonstrated less bias and better coverage for estimates of both log odds ratios and risk differences. The performance of common statistical tools for the analysis of cluster randomization designs depends heavily on the precise design, the number of clusters, and the variability of baseline outcomes and treatment effects across centres},

For example, when contrasting patients to controls, variables such as intelligence or socioeconomic status are often correlated with patient status. Similarly, when presenting word stimuli, variables such as word frequency are often correlated with primary variables of interest. One procedure very commonly employed to control for such nuisance effects is conducting inferential tests on confounding stimulus or subject characteristics. For example, if word length is not significantly different for two stimulus sets, they are considered as matched for word length. Such a test has high error rates and is conceptually misguided. It reflects a common misunderstanding of statistical tests: interpreting significance not to refer to inference about a particular population parameter, but about 1. the sample in question, 2. the practical relevance of a sample difference (so that a nonsignificant test is taken to indicate evidence for the absence of relevant differences). We show inferential testing for assessing nuisance effects to be inappropriate both pragmatically and philosophically, present a survey showing its high prevalence, and briefly discuss an alternative in the form of regression including nuisance variables.},

While avoidance as a genuine phenomenon is not proved or disproved by Schachter's data, hypotheses based on her figures suffer from the lack of methodological detail in her original study. In order to be able to establish whether avoidance is a feasible explanation for relative underproduction by a group of learners, it is necessary to look at the first language form, distribution and function of the entity supposedly being avoided in the L2 as well as the means being used to establish whether and to what extent the entity is already part of the L2 knowledge of members of that group.},

One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers & Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal  in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.},

  abstract  = {When adults learn new languages, their speech often remains noticeably non-native even after years of exposure. These non-native variants (‘accents’) can have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for learners. Many factors have been found to contribute to a learners’ proficiency in the new language. Here we examine a factor that is outside of the control of the learner, linguistic similarities between the learner’s native language (L1) and the new language (Ln). We analyze the (open access) speaking proficiencies of about 50,000 Ln learners of Dutch with 62 diverse L1s. We find that a learner’s L1 accounts for 9–22% of the variance in Ln speaking proficiency. This corresponds to 28–69% of the variance explained by a model with controls for other factors known to affect language learning, such as education, age of acquisition and length of exposure. We also find that almost 80% of the effect of L1 can be explained by combining measures of phonological, morphological, and lexical similarity between the L1 and the Ln. These results highlight the constraints that a learner’s native language imposes on language learning, and inform theories of L1-to-Ln transfer during Ln learning and use. As predicted by some proposals, we also find that L1-Ln phonological similarity is better captured when subcategorical properties (phonological features) are considered in the calculation of phonological similarities.},

Interpretable interactions can only be due to the presence of a true interactive effect in the outcome variable, regardless of the relationship that it establishes with its indicator. In the present article, we first show that same problem can arise when an unmeasured mediator has a nonlinear effect on the measured outcome variable. Then we integrate Loftus’s arguments with a seemingly contradictory approach to interactions suggested by Rosnow and Rosenthal (Psychological Bulletin 105:143–146, 1989). We show that entire data patterns, not just interaction effects alone, produce interpretable or noninterpretable interactions. Next, we show that the same problem of interpretability can apply to main effects. Lastly, we give concrete advice on what researchers can do to generate data patterns that provide unambiguous evidence for hypothesized interactions.},

In the social sciences, statistical methods fundamentally changed research practice, making statistical inference its centerpiece. At the same time, text-book writers in the social sciences have transformed rivaling statistical systems into an apparently monolithic method that could be used mechanically. The idol of a universal method for scientific inference has been worshipped since the “inference revolution” of the 1950s. Because no such method has ever been found, surrogates have been created, most notably the quest for significant p values. This form of surrogate science fosters delusions and borderline cheating and has done much harm, creating, for one, a flood of irreproducible results. Proponents of the “Bayesian revolution” should be wary of chasing yet another chimera: an apparently universal inference procedure. A better path would be to promote both an understanding of the various devices in the “statistical toolbox” and informed judgment to select among these.},

For various combinations of nonnormal distribution shapes and degrees of variance heterogeneity, the Type I error probability of a non-parametric rank test, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, was found to be biased to a far greater extent than that of its parametric counterpart, the Student t test. The Welch-Satterthwaite separate-variances version of the t test, together with a preliminary outlier detection and downweighting procedure, protected the statistical significance level more consistently than the nonparametric test did. Those findings reveal that nonparametric methods are not always acceptable substitutes for parametric methods such as the t test and the F test in research studies when parametric assumptions are not satisfied. They also indicate that multiple violations of assumptions can produce anomalous effects not observed in separate violations.},

Results: There are several ways to improve how statistics are reported. These should improve both the authors' and the readers' understanding of the data.

Conclusions: Psychology as a discipline will improve if the way in which statistics are conducted and reported is improved. This will require effort from authors, scrutiny from reviewers, and stubbornness from editors.},

  year      = {2012},
  volume    = {12},
  pages     = {81},
  abstract  = {Background
Student’s two-sample t test is generally used for comparing the means of two independent samples, for example, two treatment arms. Under the null hypothesis, the t test assumes that the two samples arise from the same normally distributed population with unknown variance. Adequate control of the Type I error requires that the normality assumption holds, which is often examined by means of a preliminary Shapiro-Wilk test. The following two-stage procedure is widely accepted: If the preliminary test for normality is not significant, the t test is used; if the preliminary test rejects the null hypothesis of normality, a nonparametric test is applied in the main analysis.

Methods
Equally sized samples were drawn from exponential, uniform, and normal distributions. The two-sample t test was conducted if either both samples (Strategy I) or the collapsed set of residuals from both samples (Strategy II) had passed the preliminary Shapiro-Wilk test for normality; otherwise, Mann-Whitney’s U test was conducted. By simulation, we separately estimated the conditional Type I error probabilities for the parametric and nonparametric part of the two-stage procedure. Finally, we assessed the overall Type I error rate and the power of the two-stage procedure as a whole.

Results
Preliminary testing for normality seriously altered the conditional Type I error rates of the subsequent main analysis for both parametric and nonparametric tests. We discuss possible explanations for the observed results, the most important one being the selection mechanism due to the preliminary test. Interestingly, the overall Type I error rate and power of the entire two-stage procedure remained within acceptable limits.

Conclusion
The two-stage procedure might be considered incorrect from a formal perspective; nevertheless, in the investigated examples, this procedure seemed to satisfactorily maintain the nominal significance level and had acceptable power properties.},

Many of them rely on the assumption of normality and are not robust to its violation. In 1960 Professor Howard Levene proposed a new approach to this problem by applying the F-test to the absolute deviations of the observations from their group means. Levene's approach is powerful and robust to nonnormality and became a very popular tool for checking the homogeneity of variances. This paper reviews the original method proposed by Levene and subsequent robust modifications. A modification of Levene-type tests to increase their power to detect monotonic trends in variances is discussed. This procedure is useful when one is concerned with an alternative of increasing or decreasing variability, for example, increasing volatility of stocks prices or "open or closed gramophones" in regression residual analysis. A major section of the paper is devoted to discussion of various scientific problems where Levene-type tests have been used, for example, economic anthropology, accuracy of medical measurements, volatility of the price of oil, studies of the consistency of jury awards in legal cases and the effect of hurricanes on ecological systems.},

The articles were analysed and the statistical techniques used were aggregated by two current writers and four PhD students in TEFL. Results showed that descriptive statistics (40.04%) were by far the most commonly used technique followed by one-way ANOVA (14.91%), t-test (10.15%), and Pearson correlation (8.76%). Regarding the sophistication level of statistical use, about 78.77% (n = 4686) of the techniques were classified as basic, 14.49% (n = 862) as intermediate, and 6.74% (n = 401) as advanced. Clearly, most of the techniques were either basic or intermediate, with a significant higher percentage for the former. So, a person with basic knowledge of statistics could understand 69.03% of the papers published during 1986 to 2015. It is discussed that researchers should be updated on recent statistical knowledge if they wish to statistically comprehend research articles published in Applied Linguistics journals.},

continue to be statistically significant is invalid, because such results may in fact be spurious. Thus,

More often than not, when these conditions are not met, Student’s t-test can be severely biased and lead to invalid statistical inferences. Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will seldom hold in psychological research, and choosing between Student’s t-test and Welch’s t-test based on the outcomes of a test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an appropriate answer. We show that the Welch’s t-test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student’s t-test when the assumptions are met. We argue that Welch’s t-test should be used as a default strategy.},

For this argument to be tenable, the familywise error rate must be defined in relation to the number of hypotheses that are tested in the same study or article. Under this conceptualization, the familywise error rate is usually unknowable in exploratory analyses because it is usually unclear how many hypotheses have been tested on a spontaneous basis and then omitted from the final research report. In the present article, I argue that it is inappropriate to conceptualize the familywise error rate in relation to the number of hypotheses that are tested. Instead, it is more appropriate to conceptualize familywise error in relation to the number of different tests that are conducted on the same null hypothesis in the same study. Under this conceptualization, alpha-level adjustments in exploratory analyses are (a) less necessary and (b) objectively verifiable. As a result, p values do not lose their meaning in exploratory analyses.},

We focus on the assumptions of normality and equality of variances, and argue that these assumptions are often unrealistic in the field of psychology. We underline the current lack of attention to these assumptions through an analysis of researchers’ practices. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we illustrate the consequences of performing the classic parametric F-test for ANOVA when the test assumptions are not met on the Type I error rate and statistical power. Under realistic deviations from the assumption of equal variances, the classic F-test can yield severely biased results and lead to invalid statistical inferences. We examine two common alternatives to the F-test, namely the Welch’s ANOVA (W-test) and the Brown-Forsythe test (F*-test). Our simulations show that under a range of realistic scenarios, the W-test is a better alternative and we therefore recommend using the W-test by default when comparing means. We provide a detailed example explaining how to perform the W-test in SPSS and R. We summarize our conclusions in practical recommendations that researchers can use to improve their statistical practices.},

  abstract  = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots).

The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram, or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example. By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for this article are available online on the journal web site.},

Objectives. We review the main implications of adopting a cluster randomized design in primary care and highlight the practical application of appropriate analytical techniques.

Methods. The application of different analytical techniques is demonstrated through the use of empirical data from a primary care-based case study.

Conclusion. Inappropriate analysis of cluster trials can lead to the presentation of inaccurate results and hence potentially misleading conclusions. We have demonstrated that adjustment for clustering can be applied to real-life data and we encourage more routine adoption of appropriate analytical techniques.},

The reluctance to use group mean as the unit of analysis is due in part to the belief that the resultant drop in the number of observations per treatment greatly reduces the probability of detecting a treatment effect. This concern is put in perspective in this paper and equations are presented to facilitate power estimates when the group mean is the unit of analysis.},

An alternative is to include covariates into the regression model that relates treatment condition to outcome. In this paper, formulae are derived in order to evaluate both strategies on basis of their costs. It is shown that the strategy that uses covariates is more cost‐efficient in detecting a treatment effect when the costs to measure these covariates are small and the correlation between the covariates and outcome is sufficiently large. The minimum required correlation depends on the cluster size, and the costs to recruit a cluster and to measure the covariate, relative to the costs to recruit a person. Measuring a covariate that varies at the person level only is recommended when cluster sizes are small and the costs to recruit and measure a cluster are large. Measuring a cluster level covariate is recommended when cluster sizes are large and the costs to recruit and measure a cluster are small. An illustrative example shows the use of the formulae in a practical setting.},

For some cases, however, it may be permissible to assume that the correlation between each two values is the same (intraclass correlation). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of this intraclass correlation on the confidence coefficients and significance levels of several well known confidence intervals and significance tests which were derived under the assumption of independence, and to extend these considerations to the case of two sets of values. In the first part of the paper the relations given in Table I are used to compute tables which show the effect of intraclass correlation on the confidence coefficients and significance levels of the confidence intervals and significance tests listed in Table II.

  abstract  = {The first section of this chapter gives an introduction to cluster randomized trials, and the reasons why such trials are often chosen above simple randomized trials. It also argues that more advanced statistical methods for data obtained from such trials are required, since these data are correlated due to the nesting of persons within clusters. Traditional statistical techniques, such as the regression model ignore this dependency, and thereby result in incorrect conclusions with respect to the effect of treatment. In the first section it is also argued that the design of cluster randomized trials is more complicated than that of simple randomized trials; not only the total sample size needs to be determined, but also the number of clusters and the number of persons per cluster.

The second section describes and compares the multilevel regression model andthe mixed effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. These models explicitly take into account the nesting of persons within clusters, and thereby the dependency of outcomes of persons within the same cluster. It is shown that the traditional regression model leads to an inflated type I error rate for treatment testing.

Optimal sample sizes for cluster randomized trials are given in Sects. 39.3 and 39.4. These sample sizes can be shown to depend on the intra-class correlation coefficient, which measures the amount of variance in the outcome variable at the cluster level. A guess of the true value of this parameter must be available in the design stage in order to calculate the optimal sample sizes. Section 39.5 focuses on the robustness of the optimal sample size against incorrect guesses of this parameter. Section 39.6 focuses on optimal designs when the aim is to estimate theintra-class correlation with the greatest precision.},

  abstract  = {Randomized trials are often designed to assess an intervention's ability to change patient knowledge, behaviour or health. The study outcome will then need to be measured at least twice for each subject---prior to random assignment and following implementation of the intervention. In this paper we consider methods for modelling change when data are obtained from cluster randomization trials where the unit of allocation is a family, school or community. Attention focuses on mixed effects linear regression extensions of (i) two-sample t-tests and (ii) analysis of covariance, in both cases accounting for dependencies among cluster members. Algebraic expressions for tests of the intervention effect are derived for the special case where there are a fixed number of subjects per cluster while simulation studies are used to compare the power of these procedures in the more realistic case where there is variability in cluster size. A key conclusion is that there can be considerable gains in power when allowing for different individual-level and cluster-level associations between the baseline and follow-up assessments. The discussion is illustrated using data from a school-based smoking prevention trial.},

  abstract  = {A common causal identification strategy in political science is selection on observables. This strategy assumes one observes a set of covariates that is, after statistical adjustment, sufficient to make treatment status as-if random. Under adjustment methods such as matching or inverse probability weighting, coefficients for control variables are treated as nuisance parameters and are not directly estimated. This is in direct contrast to regression approaches where estimated parameters are obtained for all covariates. Analysts often find it tempting to give a causal interpretation to all the parameters in such regression models—indeed, such interpretations are often central to the proposed research design. In this paper, we ask when we can justify interpreting two or more coefficients in a regression model as causal parameters. We demonstrate that analysts must appeal to causal identification assumptions to give estimates causal interpretations. Under selection on observables, this task is complicated by the fact that more than one causal effect might be identified. We show how causal graphs provide a framework for clearly delineating which effects are presumed to be identified and thus merit a causal interpretation, and which are not. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how researchers should interpret estimates from regression models when causal inference is the goal.},

Articles with over fifty hypothesis tests are no exception, but despite such an onslaught of numbers, the patterns in the data often remain opaque to readers well-versed in quantitative methods, not to mention to colleagues, students, and non-academics without years of experience in navigating results sections. I offer five suggestions for increasing both the transparency and the simplicity of quantitative research reports: (1) round numbers, (2) draw more graphs, (3) run and report fewer significance tests, (4) report simple rather than complex analyses when they yield essentially the same results, and (5) use online appendices liberally to document secondary analyses and share code and data.},

However, recent research on retrieval practice has suggested that imitating native pronunciation might be less effective than drill instruction, wherein the learner is required to produce the L2 words from memory (and given feedback). We contrasted the effectiveness of imitation and retrieval practice drills on learning L2 spoken vocabulary. Learners viewed pictures of objects and heard their names; in the imitation condition, they heard and then repeated aloud each name, whereas in the retrieval practice condition, they tried to produce the name before hearing it. On a final test administered either immediately after training (Exp. 1) or after a 2-day delay (Exp. 2), retrieval practice produced better comprehension of the L2 words, better ability to produce the L2 words, and no loss of pronunciation quality.},

  abstract  = {Causal inference is a central goal of research. However, most psychologists refrain from explicitly addressing causal research questions and avoid drawing causal inference on the basis of nonexperimental evidence. We argue that this taboo against causal inference in nonexperimental psychology impairs study design and data analysis, holds back cumulative research, leads to a disconnect between original findings and how they are interpreted in subsequent work, and limits the relevance of nonexperimental psychology for policy making. At the same time, the taboo does not prevent researchers from interpreting findings as causal effects—the inference is simply made implicitly, and assumptions remain unarticulated. Thus, we recommend that nonexperimental psychologists begin to talk openly about causal assumptions and causal effects. Only then can researchers take advantage of recent methodological advances in causal reasoning and analysis and develop a solid understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that can inform future research, theory, and policy makers.},

Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to assess differences between observed and expected birth-date distributions. Regression analyses were employed to examine the relationship between month of birth and number of players in the different samples. The results showed an over-representation of players born in the first quarter of the selection year (from January to March) for all the national youth selections at the under-15 (U-15), U-16, U-17 and U-18 age categories, as well as for the UEFA U-16 tournaments and Meridian Cup. Players with a greater relative age are more likely to be identified as “talented” because of the likely physical advantages they have over their “younger” peers. Some options for reducing the relative age effect are offered.},

In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called “co-pilot model,” and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one’s own manuscript or during the review process.},

The one‐stage approach uses the observed data as outcomes and accounts for within‐cluster correlation using a general linear mixed model. The two‐stage model uses the cluster specific means as the outcomes in a general linear univariate model. We demonstrate analytically that both one‐stage and two‐stage models achieve exact Type I error rates when cluster sizes are equal. With unbalanced data, an exact size α test does not exist, and Type I error inflation may occur. Via simulation, we compare the Type I error rates for four one‐stage and six two‐stage hypothesis testing approaches for unbalanced data. With unbalanced data, the two‐stage model, weighted by the inverse of the estimated theoretical variance of the cluster means, and with variance constrained to be positive, provided the best Type I error control for studies having at least six clusters per arm. The one‐stage model with Kenward–Roger degrees of freedom and unconstrained variance performed well for studies having at least 14 clusters per arm. The popular analytic method of using a one‐stage model with denominator degrees of freedom appropriate for balanced data performed poorly for small sample sizes and low intracluster correlation. Because small sample sizes and low intracluster correlation are common features of cluster‐randomized trials, the Kenward–Roger method is the preferred one‐stage approach.},

He argued that a Latin square should be chosen at random from the set of possible Latin squares that would fit a research design and that the Latin-square design should be carried through into the data analysis. Psychological researchers have advanced our appreciation of Latin-square designs, but they have made only moderate use of them and have not heeded Fisher's prescriptions. Educational researchers have used them even less and are vulnerable to similar criticisms. Nevertheless, the judicious use of Latin-square designs is a powerful tool for experimental researchers.},

ticity assumption seems to be of little practical importance, as an empirical compari-
son of results shows nearly identical outcomes for the two kinds of significance tests.
When linear analysis of dichotomous dependent variables is seen as acceptable, there
in many situations exist compelling arguments of a substantive nature for preferring
this approach to logistic regression. Of special importance is the intuitive meaning-
fulness of the linear measures as differences in probabilities, and their applicability in
causal (path) analysis, in contrast to the logistic measures.},

  volume   = {70},
  pages    = {86-116},
  abstract = {In phonetics, many datasets are encountered which deal with dynamic data collected over time. Examples include diphthongal formant trajectories and articulator trajectories observed using electromagnetic articulography. Traditional approaches for analyzing this type of data generally aggregate data over a certain timespan, or only include measurements at a fixed time point (e.g., formant measurements at the midpoint of a vowel). This paper discusses generalized additive modeling, a non-linear regression method which does not require aggregation or the pre-selection of a fixed time point. Instead, the method is able to identify general patterns over dynamically varying data, while simultaneously accounting for subject and item-related variability. An advantage of this approach is that patterns may be discovered which are hidden when data is aggregated or when a single time point is selected. A corresponding disadvantage is that these analyses are generally more time consuming and complex. This tutorial aims to overcome this disadvantage by providing a hands-on introduction to generalized additive modeling using articulatory trajectories from L1 and L2 speakers of English within the freely available R environment. All data and R code is made available to reproduce the analysis presented in this paper.},

Across six weeks, 260 Swiss German learners of English as a foreign language (17 classes) completed three vocabulary learning tests (T1, T2 and T3). Additionally, 7 of these 17 classes attended a 90-minute intervention between the first and second test: During a 45-minute introductory lesson students discovered four systematic orthographic correspondence rules (e.g. <p> to <f> as in ship and Schiff), followed by three 15-minute sessions to consolidate their knowledge. The intervention group’s improvement in cognate learning was significantly larger in comparison to the control group. The difference was observed across both test modes and all rules introduced. While learners’ initial English vocabulary size correlated with their overall performance, it did not affect intervention uptake. This suggests that these younger learners benefitted from form-focused instruction, independent of proficiency and type of correspondence.},

  abstract = {Learning new vocabulary from context typically requires multiple encounters during which word meaning can be retrieved from memory or inferred from context. We compared the effect of memory retrieval and context inferences on short- and long-term retention in three experiments. Participants studied novel words and then practiced the words either in an uninformative context that required the retrieval of word meaning from memory (“I need the funguo”) or in an informative context from which word meaning could be inferred (“I want to unlock the door: I need the funguo”). The informative context facilitated word comprehension during practice. However, later recall of word form and meaning and word recognition in a new context were better after successful retrieval practice and retrieval practice with feedback than after context-inference practice. These findings suggest benefits of retrieval during contextualized vocabulary learning whereby the uninformative context enhanced word retention by triggering memory retrieval.},
