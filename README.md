# Working with datasets and visualising data in R: Two primers

* The .html files are web pages containing the course's contents.
* The .qmd files are the source files from which the web pages and the .pdf files were generated.
* The `data` directory contains the datasets we'll be working with.
* The `functions` directory contains an R function for drawing scatterplot matrices.
* The `templates` directory contains two templates of R scripts that show how you can write R scripts and compile these to (say) .html files. The .qmd files in the main directory are more advanced examples of this. See the [_R Markdown: The definitive guide_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)) as well as the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) documentation for more information.
